      "['No Synopsis', '\"Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend...\" A mysterious panda donning a flowing cape and sedge hat walks through the Chinese landscape. Reputed to be a grand master of kung fu, he enters a tavern where he is immediately attacked by the local ruffians. However, they are no match for his skill and even the legendary kung fu masters, the Furious Five, bow down to the panda\\'s skill, requesting to hang out with him and fight alongside him as...\\n\\n...Po the giant panda (Jack Black) wakes up from his dream in his room. His goose father, Mr. Ping (James Hong) calls to him from the noodle restaurant below to help serve tables. Po admires his Furious Five action figures before going downstairs. An extreme fan of Kung Fu, Po dreams of one day becoming a master worthy of fighting alongside the Five but his girth and clumsiness makes this dream simply a dream and his kung fu talents reside only within his knowledge of moves and artifacts. He is hesitant to express his desires to his dad who is more interested in running his restaurant and advertising his famous \\'secret ingredient soup\\'.\\n\\nMaster Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a red panda who resides at the Jade Palace temple, practices kung fu in the courtyard with his students, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen), before he is summoned to see tortoise Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). Fearing something is wrong, Shifu rushes to find him meditating in the grand hall. Oogway doesn\\'t deny bad news but calmly tells Shifu he\\'s predicted that the snow leopard warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape prison and return to the Valley of Peace to wreak destruction once again. Intent on never letting this happen, Shifu sends his goose messenger, Zeng (Dan Fogler), to fly to Chor-Gom Prison to ensure that security is increased. Oogway then proclaims that it is time to choose the Dragon Warrior; a master of great skill who will be granted the secrets of the universe by reading the Dragon Scroll, kept delicately out of reach on the temple ceiling. Assuming that one of the Furious Five will be chosen, Shifu prepares a competition to determine which one will qualify.\\n\\nFlyers for the competition are spread throughout town and the villagers flock to the temple. Excited to have the opportunity to see his idols in person, Po follows with his noodle cart in tow but struggles on the long staircase to the temple. He is the last to arrive at the gates and finds that they\\'ve shut him out. In a desperate bid to see the competition before it\\'s over, Po fashions fireworks to his cart and blasts himself high into the air, only to come crashing down in the arena just as Oogway is preparing to choose out of the Five. Po opens his eyes to see Oogway\\'s finger pointed right at him and is shocked, along with everyone else, when he is proclaimed to be the Dragon Warrior. Oogway\\'s decision is final, despite Shifu\\'s protests, and Po is carried (unsuccessfully) into the temple leaving Tigress greatly disappointed since it seemed Oogway would have chosen her if Po hadn\\'t arrived.\\n\\nInside the temple, Po examines, with awe, the many weaponry and valuable artifacts before Shifu approaches him and berates him for his obvious lack of skill. He deflates Po\\'s excitement by grabbing his finger in what Po recognizes as the Wuxi Finger Hold, reputed to be extremely powerful. Shifu promises that Po will regret ever being chosen before taking him to the Fives training room where Po is promptly put to the test. Nervous, but excited to try some kung fu moves, Po accepts the challenge but is hurtled, flung, and beaten down to a now-existing Level 0.\\n\\nOn the way to the dormitories, Po overhears the Five poke fun at his incompetence. He has an awkward conversation with Crane, opening up to his own doubts of being the Dragon Warrior. Tigress assures his doubts, calling him a disgrace to kung fu and tells him that, if he is wise, he will leave by morning. Disheartened, Po retreats to a secluded spot. Oogway finds him sitting beneath the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom with peaches stuffed into his mouth. Sensing his distress, and noting that he finds comfort in food, Oogway tells Po that he worries too much about what was or what could be. He should instead focus on the present moment rather than doubting himself.\\n\\nRenewed with a sense of determination, Po rises the next morning before anyone else and announces that he will stay to train. He spars with each of the Furious Five, receiving swift beatings despite his undeterred enthusiasm. Frustrated by Po\\'s perseverance, Shifu is at a loss. However, the Five become impressed by Po\\'s fortitude and eventually start to warm up to him, with the exception of Tigress. During an acupuncture session with Mantis, the Five reveal that Shifu was not always as stern as he currently is. Tigress explains that Tai Lung himself was the reason for Shifu\\'s shift in personality. Having found him as a newborn on the steps of the temple, Shifu raised Tai Lung as his own and began to hope that he was the fabled Dragon Warrior when the cub displayed a natural talent in kung fu. However, when the time came to stand before Oogway, the grand master sensed darkness in Tai Lung and denied him the honor of receiving the Dragon Scroll. Enraged, Tai Lung went on a rampage through the village and attempted to take the scroll by force. Caring for him too much, Shifu was unable to fight Tai Lung and Oogway was forced to defeat him by blocking his chi. Tigress then says that Shifu never cared for anything or anyone since, not even her; his own foster daughter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Zeng arrives at Chor-Gom Prison and is escorted to Tai Lung\\'s hold by the over-confident Commander Vachir (Michael Clarke Duncan), a rhinoceros. Vachir assures Zeng that the prison is inescapable as one of Zeng\\'s feathers falls within reach of Tai Lung. Using his tail, he uses the feather to remove the chi-blockers in the turtle-shell contraption on his back and break free. Tai Lung escapes the prison in an explosive display of his fierce kung fu abilities and grabs Zeng, instructing him to fly back to Shifu to announce that the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.\\n\\nBack at the temple, Po entertains the Five with some noodle soup he prepared, imitating Shifu using a noodle as a mustache. Outside, Shifu is met by a disheveled Zeng who relays the news. Panicked, Shifu finds Oogway beside the Sacred Peach Tree and tells him that Tai Lung is on his way. Oogway is shocked, but assures Shifu that, if he finds faith in the panda and trains him, Tai Lung will be defeated and Shifu will finally find inner peace. He then gives Shifu his wooden staff and claims that his time has come. He walks near the edge of the cliff side and vanishes in a haze of peach blossoms. Shifu returns to the temple, disconsolate, and informs the Five of Oogway\\'s passing and how Po is their last chance to defeat Tai Lung. Horrified, Po flees from the temple but is soon stopped by Shifu. Po confronts Shifu, saying that he tried to kick him out of the temple. When Shifu asks Po why he then stayed knowing that his teacher wanted him to quit, Po confesses a deep self-loathing as a fat failure how he held out a faint hope that Shifu could change him. As Shifu realizes how spiritually burdened the giant panda is, Po asks how he will train him to become the Dragon Warrior. Facing such an challenge with a student so encumbered in multiple respects, Shifu admits that he doesn\\'t know.\\n\\nOverhearing this from the temple roof, Tigress leaves the Jade Palace and runs out to the countryside, soon followed by the rest of the Five, to meet Tai Lung head on. They find him crossing the Thread of Hope, a series of bridges through the mountains. They attempt to stop him on the last bridge. After an epic battle, the Five gain the upper hand and appear to have defeated Tai Lung, tying him to the remains of the severed bridge and sending him into the mist below. However, Tai Lung\\'s skills prove superior, and he surprises them by flinging himself onto the cliff and overpowering them with a chi block.\\n\\nRising that morning, Shifu finds Po in the temple kitchen, surrounded by cabinets with perfect hole punches in the doors and boards broken clean in two. Shifu entertains an idea and tells Po where Monkey keeps his cookies before hiding behind the doorway. He reenters and sees Po performing a perfect split near the ceiling, chowing down on the cookies. Realizing Po\\'s latent talent, Shifu takes him high into the Wu Dan Mountains to the Pool of Sacred Tears where Oogway founded the origins of kung fu. With a dramatic flourish, Shifu proclaims to be Po\\'s master, with full faith in his student at last. With that emotional support, Shifu begins his rigorous training Po, using food as a reward. Po\\'s unique training proves to be successful and he grows stronger and more coordinated while Shifu\\'s own spirits rises and advances at Po\\'s rapid improvement. Shifu\\'s faith in Po is vindicated in an increasingly energetic duel over a dumpling that becomes a wild spar in which the Giant Panda fights with powerful and innovative skill to win. However, it is when Po throws back the dumpling he won that Shifu has truly advanced, with a newfound emotional strength and serenity.\\n\\nThey return to the temple as Crane flies in, carrying the rest of the Five, who have been paralyzed by Tai Lung\\'s attacks. Shifu rejuvenates them but Po is discouraged by the fact that five masters could not overpower Tai Lung; how could he? Shifu assures him that he will have what no one else has; the Dragon Scroll. Shifu retrieves it for Po and instructs him to read it, but Po exclaims in surprise to find nothing but a blank, reflective glaze on the scroll. Terribly disappointed, Shifu relents to have the Five evacuate the village while he remains at the temple to hold Tai Lung off. The Five reluctantly agree and Po returns to his father who is packing up the noodle shop. Ping tries to console Po, but Po admits that hes not sure of who he is and can\\'t believe he\\'s Ping\\'s son. Taken aback, Ping whispers to Po something he should have told him long ago; the secret ingredient to his famous secret ingredient soup. The secret is... nothing. He explains that something becomes special if people truly believe that it is. Po opens the scroll to see his reflection on its glazed surface and realizes the secret before turning back to the temple.\\n\\nShifu waits at the top of the steps until Tai Lung arrives. Refusing to give his old student the scroll, Shifu battles Tai Lung. Tai Lung demands his birthright to have the scroll and blames Shifu for planting dreams in his head of what he thought was his destiny and not standing up to Oogway when the turtle disagreed. Shifu, while fending off his adoptive sons\\' attacks, justifies that he is obeying his master\\'s judgment and it was Oogway\\'s decision to make alone. However, when Tai Lung see Master Oogway\\'s memorial, the snow leopard sneeringly counters that Shifu has obviously replaced the late Master and thus the red panda now has the authority to arbitrarily overrule Oogway\\'s decision. Infuriated at the idea of disrespecting his teacher\\'s legacy like that, Shifu goes on the attack.\\n\\nIn the battlle, Tai Lung wails, with a subtle undertone of grief and abandonment, at Shifu to tell him how proud he is and Shifu admits that he was proud from the first moment, but it was his pride that blinded him from seeing what Tai Lung was becoming. Tai Lung is momentarily moved by this confession, but his vindictive ambition spitefully reasserts. Denying any interest in apologies or any reconciliation with his foster father, Tai Lung demands only the scroll. He is stopped from dealing a deadly blow to Shifu by Po, who appears, exhausted, at the doorway of the temple. Baffled by the Dragon Warrior\\'s pudgy exterior, Tai Lung nonetheless attacks Po when he reveals the Dragon Scroll in hand. Their battle takes them into the village, each one vying for possession of the scroll. At one point, Po imagines the scroll as a bowl of dumplings to encourage him to climb a high precipice to get it, but Tai Lung is convinced that the scroll is giving him power.\\n\\nAfter a protracted battle, Tai Lung finally wins the scroll and triumphantly opens it for the supposed power within. However, upon seeing the golden reflection within, he completely fails to understand its symbolic meaning. When Po rises to explain it, Tai Lung refuses to accept the panda\\'s words or the fact that everything the snow leopard has betrayed and sacrificed in his eyes has been for apparently nothing.\\n\\nNow consumed with such enraged despair, Tai Lung attacks Po again, but without discipline or real purpose behind it. Using ingenuity and his rebounding stomach, Po manages to render Tai Lung helpless. Tai Lung spews out a slur of insults before Po takes his finger in the Wuxi Finger Hold. Tai Lung calls Pos bluff and Po admits that Shifu never taught him the move - he figured it out on his own. With a triumphant \"Skadoosh!\", Po flexes his pinky, resulting in a magnificent wave of raw energy that resonates throughout the valley and is felt by the Five leading the refugees into the hills. Having presumably killed Tai Lung, Po is cheered on by the returning villagers. Tigress and the rest of the Five bow down to Po, calling him master, before Po runs back to the temple to check on Shifu. He finds Shifu lying still, but alive, on the floor of the temple and tells him he defeated Tai Lung. Shifu thanks him and tells Po that he\\'s brought him peace before closing his eyes. Po calls out to him and Shifu reprimands him, saying that he\\'s merely resting. Po lies down beside him and, after a quiet, meditative moment, asks if he wants to get something to eat. Shifu says, Ok.\\n\\nThey enjoy a meal of dumplings together at the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom, overlooking a new day while a seed that Shifu had previously planted begins to bloom.', 'Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is dissatisfied with life under the sea and curious about the human world. With her best fish friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts and goes to the surface of the ocean to visit Scuttle the seagull, who offers very inaccurate and comical knowledge of human culture. Ignoring the warnings of her father (King Triton) and head maestro (Sebastian the crab) that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden (the sea\\'s primary contact with humans involve fishermen, so King Triton considers humans as nothing more than mere predators), Ariel still longs to be part of the human world; to this end she has filled a secret grotto with all the human artifacts she has found. (\"Part of Your World\") Sebastian, who is assigned to watch over Ariel and be sure she does not visit the surface again, tries to convince her that its better to live under the sea than in the human world (\"Under the Sea\").\\n\\nOne night, Ariel, Flounder and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the birthday of Prince Eric, with whom Ariel falls in love. A sudden storm hits, during which everyone manages to escape in a lifeboat except for Eric who goes back to rescue his dog Max. He almost drowns saving Max but is saved by Ariel, who drags him to the beach. Although it seems that his heart isn\\'t beating, Ariel notices that Eric is breathing. She sings to him but dives underwater when Max returns to Eric. Upon being assisted by his chancellor (Sir Grimsby), Eric has a vague impression that he was rescued by a girl with a beautiful voice; he vows to find her, and Ariel vows to find a way to join Eric. (\"Part of Your World (reprise)\")\\n\\nTriton and his daughters notice a change in Ariel, who is openly lovesick. Triton questions Sebastian about Ariel\\'s behavior, during which Sebastian accidentally reveals the incident with Eric. Triton furiously confronts Ariel in her grotto, using his trident to destroy her collection of human treasures. After Triton leaves, a pair of eels, Flotsam and Jetsam, convince a crying Ariel that she must visit Ursula the sea witch, if she wants all of her dreams to come true.\\n\\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days (\"Poor, Unfortunate Souls\"). Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \\'kiss of true love\\' from Eric; otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid on the third day and belong to Ursula. As payment for legs, Ariel has to give up her voice, which Ursula takes by magically removing the energy from Ariel\\'s vocal chords and storing it in a nautilus shell. Ariel\\'s tail is transformed into legs, leaving her naked except for her seashell bra. Sebastian and Flounder drag her to the surface. Meanwhile, Triton discovers Ariel and Sebastian\\'s disappearance and, wracked with guilt over his behavior, orders a search for them.\\n\\nEric and Max find Ariel on the beach. He initially suspects that she is the one who saved his life, but when he learns that she cannot speak, he discards that notion, to the frustration of both Ariel and Max (who knows the truth). He helps her to the palace, where the servants think she is a survivor of a shipwreck. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss (\"Kiss the Girl\") but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Angered at their narrow escape, Ursula takes the disguise of a beautiful young woman named \"Vanessa\" and appears onshore singing with Ariel\\'s voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Vanessa/Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel.\\n\\nThe next day, Ariel finds out that Eric will be married to the disguised Ursula on a ship. She cries and is left behind when the wedding barge departs. Scuttle discovers that Vanessa is Ursula in disguise, and informs Ariel. As Ariel and Flounder chase the wedding barge, Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle is assigned to literally \"stall the wedding.\" With the help of various animals, the nautilus shell around Ursula\\'s neck is broken, restoring Ariel\\'s voice and breaking Ursula\\'s enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel was the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Ursula reverts to her true form and kidnaps Ariel.\\n\\nTriton appears and confronts Ursula, but cannot destroy Ursula\\'s contract with Ariel. Triton chooses to sacrifice himself for his daughter, and is transformed into a polyp. Ursula takes Triton\\'s crown and trident, which was her plan from the beginning. Ursula uses her new power to gloat, transforming into a giant, and forming a whirlpool that disturbs several shipwrecks to the surface, one of which Eric commandeers. Just as Ursula is set to use the trident to destroy Ariel, Eric turns the wheel hard to port and runs Ursula through the abdomen with the ship\\'s splintered bowsprit, mortally wounding her. With her last breaths, Ursula pulls the ship down with her, but Eric escapes to shore in time.\\n\\nWith Ursula gone, her power breaks and the polyps in Ursula\\'s garden (including Triton) turn back into the old merpeople. Later, after seeing that Ariel really loves Eric and that Eric also saved him in the process, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human using his trident. She runs into Eric\\'s arms, and the two finally kiss.\\n\\nIn the final scene, an unspecified amount of time later, Ariel marries Eric in a wedding where both humans and merpeople attend.', 'Prologue: The Boy Samurai and The Headless Ancestor The film opens with a legend of a war between three clans. Two of them worshiped dogs while the Kobayashi clan were cat lovers. The clans fought in battle until a child warrior came forth and decapitated the head of the Kobayashi clan. Centuries later, the Kobayashi family has not forgiven their greatest defeat.\\n\\nWe jump ahead to twenty years in the future from now in the Japanese city of Megasaki. An outbreak of \"snout fever\" has been infecting dogs across the country. Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura) issues a decree that will send all dogs to a quarantined piece of land they call Trash Island. The first dog sent there is Spots (Liev Schrieber), the pet/bodyguard of Kobayashi\\'s orphaned nephew Atari (Koyu Rankin). The head of the Science Party, Professor Watanabe (Akira Ito), believes the dogs can be cured. Interpreter Nelson (Frances McDormand)(who translates and commentates on major events in the city) muses \"Whatever happened to man\\'s best friend?\"\\n\\nPart One: The Little Pilot On Trash Island, there is a pack of five dogs - Rex (Edward Norton), King (Bob Balaban), Duke (Jeff Goldblum), Boss (Bill Murray), and their leader, Chief (Bryan Cranston). The city imports bags of garbage as a means of food for the dogs. One bag drops, and Chief\\'s pack comes across a rival pack of dogs. They get into a wild fight for the garbage, with Chief even biting off another dog\\'s ear. His pack comes out victorious, but Rex, who is a former house pet, says he can\\'t stomach anymore of the garbage. King, Boss, and Duke agree, as they were also domesticated, but Chief, a stray, is more thankful for what they have. The dogs then spot a female dog, Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), walking by.\\n\\nA plane flown by Atari comes crashing down to the island. The dogs go after him when they see the wreckage. Atari has a piece of the plane stuck in his head. He sees the dogs and uses a picture to tell them he is looking for Spots. The dogs don\\'t know him personally, but they know he\\'s the first dog who was sent there. They bring Atari to what they believe is his cage, where a dog skeleton lies because none of the other dogs knew how to open it. Atari becomes distraught and enraged.\\n\\nWe see a flashback to when Atari first got Spots after the train accident that killed his parents. Atari lost his right kidney in the same accident. Kobayashi\\'s Major-Domo (Akira Takayama) brings Spots in and doesn\\'t appear to approve of Atari treating Spots like a pet. Atari begins to whisper to Spots, and, with tears in his eyes, he tells the boy he can understand him.\\n\\nAtari attempts to leave the island. Rex notices Boss wearing the collar of the dog in the cage, and sees that the tag says \"Sport\" and not Spots. After Atari crashes the plane again, the dogs decide to help him look for Spots, but Chief doesn\\'t trust Atari and refuses to help him, but the dogs overrule his decision.\\n\\nAt night, Chief meets Nutmeg formally. He pries into her life by asking about who she\\'s mating with, which she doesn\\'t approve of. After apologizing, he gets to talk to her more. Nutmeg says she is a former show dog who could perform tricks. She asks Chief if he is going to help Atari since boys like him love dogs. Chief is unsure, but ultimately agrees to go along with the mission.\\n\\nAt a lab in the city, Watanabe successfully discovers the cure for the canine flu. He and his assistant scientist, Yoko Ono (Yoko Ono), present their discovery to Kobayashi, but he dismisses it and plans to keep the dogs on Trash Island. He leaves the room, at which point Watanabe sees a file containing classified information regarding the canine flu and Trash Island, but the Major-Domo swipes it away from Watanabe before he can find out anything.\\n\\nPart Two: The Search For Spots On their way to find Spots, the dogs start talking about their favorite foods. When they ask Chief, he reveals to them that he wasn\\'t always a stray. He was owned by a family until he bit the hand of the oldest boy when he tried to pet Chief. He claims it was so bad that he almost bit the boy\\'s hand off completely. The family locked him in a shed, but the grandmother brought him a bowl of hibachi chili, which he says was his favorite food. He dug his way out and became a stray.\\n\\nA rescue team searching for Atari comes down along with a drone and a robot dog. The captors trap Atari, but the pack intervenes to fight them off and save Atari. Chief battles the robot dog and gets injured, but Atari is set free and he disables the robot dog. The drone also ends up crashing down to the ground.\\n\\nAt a school in Megasaki City, exchange student Tracy Walker (Greta Gerwig) presents a theory to her class that involves a conspiracy within the Kobayashi party, and she plans to do whatever it takes to prove that the mayor is corrupt. She organizes a televised rally with the other children to call for a reform in the way they are handling the dog situation. The kids hold up pictures of their dogs, and we learn that Tracy is Nutmeg\\'s owner.\\n\\nAtari and the dogs set out to find the dogs Jupiter (F. Murray Abraham) and Oracle (Tilda Swinton), as they are known as the wisest dogs on the island. Oracle supposedly has \"visions\", but she is actually just able to understand the TV and translate what\\'s happening. Upon finding them, Jupiter and Oracle recognize Spots in his picture as \"Dog Zero\". Jupiter suggests that Spots may be on the island as a prisoner of a group of cannibal aboriginal dogs.\\n\\nThe group attempts to head further to find Spots, but Chief and Atari get split up from the other four dogs. After they land, Atari attempts to play with Chief, who is reluctant at first, but eventually warms up to the boy. He even lets Atari pet him. He then gives Chief a bath, completely removing the filth off of him to reveal that he is the same breed as Spots.\\n\\nBack in Megasaki, a chef is preparing sushi. He dabs one of the rolls with poisoned wasabi and has it sent to the room of Professor Watanabe. He is reported dead in the morning from what is believed to have been a suicide. Tracy continues her investigation into the matter, even going to confront a devastated Yoko to confirm that the cure exists. Yoko gives it to Tracy so she can set out to expose the truth.\\n\\nPart Three: The Rendez-Vous Atari and Chief reunite with Rex, Boss, King, and Duke as they reach a bridge that will lead them to the aboriginal tribe. The four dogs get stuck on the trash lift that they came in on, but Atari and Chief make it across. They are confronted once again by Kobayashi\\'s men, plus more robot dogs. Just when it looks like time is up for the two, they are found by none other than SPOTS.\\n\\nAnother flashback shows Spots being found by the group of aboriginal dogs, but he learns from their leader, Gondo (Harvey Keitel), that they only ate their former leader because he was already sick and dying, and so the other dogs had no choice but to eat him since there was little else for them to survive off of. Gondo admits that this really hurt him and the others, but he doesn\\'t like that they have a reputation as cannibal dogs. They find a key for Spots\\'s cage, and they free him. Spots then meets his future mate, Peppermint (Kara Hayward).\\n\\nBack in the present, Spots uses his military-issued explosive teeth to take out the robot dogs. Spots takes Chief and Atari and jumps into the river to escape the others. While they float away, Spots tells Atari that he can no longer serve him and be his bodyguard because of his new role in the tribe, and because he and Peppermint are going to be parents. He also confirms to Chief that they are brothers. Chief is at first disgusted with Spots since Atari went through all this just for him, but Spots then decides that he may now pass his former role onto Chief. Atari places Spots\\'s mic and earpiece onto Chief, who accepts his new role.\\n\\nPart Four: Atari\\'s Lantern Atari, Chief, and Spots encounter a messenger owl sent to them from Jupiter. They learn that Kobayashi is planning to take care of the city\\'s dog problem by effectively poisoning them with gas. Atari leads his dogs to head out on rafts back toward the city to stop this.\\n\\nThe city is gathered for Kobayashi\\'s election ceremony. Atari is believed to have been dead after the bridge jump. Tracy and her classmates arrive to protest, with Tracy trying to expose Kobayashi\\'s corruption, as well as the fact that he and his team manufactured the canine flu out of their hatred for dogs, and the fact that Watanabe was murdered. As a result, she has her student visa nullified and is set to be deported. Atari, Chief, and the other dogs arrive. They administer the cure to Chief, who is immediately relieved of the canine flu. Atari then stands up to speak and deliver a speech and a haiku, which moves Kobayashi to tears and causes him to have a change of heart. He undoes the Trash Island Decree and admits to his corruption and acting dishonorably. He tries to cancel the poisoning, but the Major-Domo tries to see the extermination through. They press a button and activate the poison, but thanks to one of Tracy\\'s hacker friends, the poison backfires and affects the robot dogs and exterminators on the island. A robot dog then tries to attack Atari and the other dogs, but Spots intervenes and fights the robot dog. It is destroyed, but Spots loses an eye, and Atari has a metal part lodged in his head.\\n\\nAtari undergoes a successful brain surgery, but his remaining kidney has failed. Kobayashi decides to donate his left kidney to save his nephew\\'s life.\\n\\nKobayashi and his whole party are locked up for their crimes. Due to the election law, Atari becomes the new mayor of Megasaki. He makes it so that all dogs are returned to their owners and that they may return to society. This helps former dog-based businesses return, including a dog treat factory that the other dogs loved. Atari and Tracy become a couple, which allows Chief to get closer to Nutmeg.\\n\\nThe last we see is Spots (now sporting a mechanical eye) with Peppermint and their puppies, living in the Kobayashi manor in peace.', 'No Synopsis', 'The city of Monstropolis in a world entirely populated by monsters is powered by energy from the screams of human children. At the Monsters, Inc., factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to children\\'s bedroom closets.\\n\\nThe factory has a huge warehouse containing thousands of doors, work areas called \"scare floors\" where the doors are activated and the energy from the screams of human children are contained in energy containers, and a simulator room in which employees practice their scare skills in a simulator. Work at the factory is considered dangerous, as human children are believed to be toxic.\\n\\nThe story takes place in Monstropolis, a city populated entirely by monsters. Monstropolis is not part of the human world, but it can be connected to children\\'s bedrooms through their closet doors. When a door is properly activated, it becomes a portal between the monster world and the human world. The city\\'s power supply is provided by Monsters, Inc., a utility company that employs monsters to scare children and extract energy from their screams. The company has a huge warehouse full of doors, work areas called \"scare floors\" where the doors are activated, and a special training room in which employees practice their scare skills. The company\\'s best scarer is James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (Goodman), whose assistant is his best friend, Michael \"Mike\" Wazowski (Crystal). Sulley\\'s main rival is Randall Boggs (Buscemi), and the company\\'s CEO is Henry J. Waternoose III (Coburn). Monstropolis is in the middle of an energy crisis because children are harder to scare than they used to be.\\n\\nOne day, Sully finds an activated door on his scare floor after the workday has ended. He finds no one in the room behind the door, but a little two-year-old girl (Gibbs) follows him back into the monster world. Far from being scared, she calls him \"Kitty\" and delights in playing with him. Since monsters believe humans are lethally toxic, Sully tries repeatedly to return the girl to her room, but she keeps following him back, and Randall eventually deactivates and stores the door, leaving the girl stuck in the monster world. The girl\\'s presence becomes public knowledge after Sully sneaks her into a restaurant to find Mike, so they hide her in Sully\\'s home while the Child Detection Agency (CDA) searches for her. Sully eventually names the girl \"Boo\", and he slowly bonds with her after realizing that she is not poisonous. He also discovers that her laughter produces even more energy than her screams.\\n\\nThe next morning, Sully and Mike disguise Boo in a monster costume and sneak her into work. Randall agrees to help them return her to her bedroom, but when Mike enters the room, Randall captures him in a box, believing he is Boo. Randall intends to kidnap Boo and subject her to a device that extracts her screams.\\n\\nWhat follows is a sequence of battles, chases, and mishaps in which Sully and Mike attempt to protect Boo from Randall and his scream machine. Waternoose reveals that he is in cahoots with Randall and banishes Sully and Mike to the Himalayas, where they meet the Abominable Snowman (John Ratzenberger), but Sully and Mike return to the monster world through a village at the foot of the mountain, where Randall chases them through the company\\'s roller-coaster-like door-moving system. When the energy in Boo\\'s laughter activates the doors in storage, the chase passes in and out of the human world. Finally, Sully and Boo defeat Randall. Sully throws Randall through the door of a trailer-park trailer, where a woman beats Randall with a shovel, and Mike destroys the door to make sure Randall never comes back.\\n\\nJust as Sully and Mike attempt to return Boo to her home, Waternoose and the CDA call her door to the scare floor, ready to arrest them, but Mike leads the agents away by fleeing with Boo\\'s monster costume, and Sully escapes with Boo and the door. When Waternoose follows Sully and Boo, Sulley attempts to set up and activate the door, and when Waternoose follows them through the door, he tells Sully he is willing to kidnap children in order to save the company. However, Sully had not properly activated Boo\\'s door, causing the three to actually wind up in the adjacent Monsters, Inc. training room, which is equipped with a video monitoring system.

The only living creature in his 'environment,' Rango has fancied himself as an actor, with several inanimate object as his friends and fellow thespians. In his self-contained world, Rango's 'friends' tell him that even though he fancies himself a hero, he needs a challenge.\\n\\nThe world goes awry when something in the road causes the car to jolt, and the chameleon and his aquarium fly out the back of the vehicle he's in, shattering to the ground. Getting up, the chameleon sees an armadillo in the road, it's mid-section squashed in by a tire. The creature asks for help to get to the other side, and the chameleon assists. Not being used to the heat, the chameleon asks the armadillo where he can find water. The creature tells him he can find it in dirt, a day's journey away.\\n\\ntThe chameleon follows his shadow through the desert, but is almost eaten by a hawk. Taking refuge in a storm drain, the chameleon wakes the next morning to a small rush of water that quickly evaporates in the sun. Close by, he comes across a female lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher). Though at first hostile, Beans gives the chameleon a ride into town. The chameleon attempts to blend in with the locals, and makes his way to a nearby saloon. Going in, he arouses the suspicion of almost everyone in the bar. Several ask to know who he is, and after seeing the word 'Durango' on a bottle of cactus juice, the chamelon claims that his name...is Rango.\\n\\nRango then attempts to spin a story that makes him seem like a hero. When someone asks if he killed some outlaws known as The Jenkins Brothers, Rango claims to have done it with just one bullet. As he talks, a couple of outlaws enter the room, led by a lizard named Bad Bill (Ray Winstone). Rango attempts to act intimidating, but instead rouses Bill's ire, leading to the two having a showdown in the middle of the town.\\n\\nRango thinks he's scared off Bad Bill and his boys when they run away...only to realize the hawk he outwitted before is right behind him. Rango then goes running through the town, with the final events looking as if Rango was chasing the hawk, before finally killing him by dropping the town's water tower on it. While some rejoice at the death of the hawk, several make mention that with the hawk's death, a desperado by the name of Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) could very well return to town. However, Rango casually explains that he isn't afraid, and that he and Jake are brothers.\\n\\nRango is then brought before the town's Mayor (Ned Beatty), an old turtle who claims that Rango has given the townspeople hope. Rango is then made the town Sheriff.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Rango watches perplexed as the townsfolk take part in a strange ritual in which they leave Dirt and head towards a spigot in the desert. The townspeople seek 'salvation' from the spigot, but no water materializes. The townsfolk have been hard-up for water for some time, and after the Mayor admits sacrifices will need to be made, Beans steps forward, accusing the Mayor of somehow being behind their water shortage.\\n\\nIt soon becomes clear that the town's bank is also short on water, and the reserves in the vault only has enough water for 5 more days. Rango attempts to quell the townsfolk's further worries, by promising to uphold the law. However, he accidentally mistakes some moles looking to rob the local bank for prospectors, and allows them to continue on, even giving them equipment.\\n\\nThe next day, word of the bank robbery spreads. Rango leads a search party through the underground tunnels that criss-cross below the desert. The group then finds a large pipe and follow it out into the desert, where they find the Bank Manager Mr Merrimack, dead.\\n\\nSome distance off, they find the moles with a covered wagon with what appears to be the water jug that once sat in the bank. The group manages to take off with the covered wagon, but not before the moles and the rest of their underground brethren give chase. However, during the chase, the covered tarp on the jug comes undone, and the bottle is found to be empty.\\n\\nOne of the moles that brought the jug to his father claims it was empty when he found it, but the townspeople assume the moles made off with their water. The three moles are returned to town for a trial, but the now apparent lack of water has the rest of the town worried.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Rango has come to suspect the Mayor even more. When the Mayor gets wind of Rango's suspicions regarding him, he sends his men to find Rattlesnake Jake. Jake has been told the stories that Rango has mentioned, and gets Rango to confess that everything he has said is a lie, including the death of the Jenkins Brothers (which were actually killed by Jake).\\n\\nRango then walks out of Dirt, disgraced. He eventually makes his way back to the 2-lane highway. He attempts to cross it like the armadillo from before, and manages to make it across before collapsing. Unconscious, he is carried over the sandy terrain where he encounters 'The Spirit of the West.' The Spirit gives Rango some more courage, but is then helped along by the Armadillo (his mid-section now restored), and some moving cacti. The reach the top of a crest, and down below, see a large city (Las Vegas). Nearby is an emergency valve that appears to have been cut off. It soon makes sense what the Mayor is planning: he intends to make the town of Dirt into the large city below. Rango had also heard that the Mayor had been buying up lots of land, but that Beans was one of the last hold-outs.\\n\\nRango then returns to Dirt with a plan. He confronts the Mayor and Rattlesnake Jake, who are attempting to coerce Beans into signing over the title to her property. Rango challenges Jake to a duel, and at High Noon, the armadillo and the cacti open the emergency valve, and water floods throughout the town. However, in the wake of Beans possibly being killed, Rango surrenders, and the two are placed in the bank's vault, where the Mayor attempts to drown them. While this is going on, the Mayor's men then turn their guns on Rattlesnake Jake, with the Mayor confidently speaking of how his type will soon be a distant memory.\\n\\nRango ends up inadvertently turning the tables when one bullet he has manages to break the vault's glass, and the water in the vault washes everyone out into the streets. Jake acknowledges what Rango did, before turning on the Mayor, dragging him out into the desert as the turtle pleads for his life.\\n\\nThe citizens then celebrate their newfound fortune as the water rains down around them.\", 'A street peddler (Robin Williams) is guiding the audience through the streets of the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah. After trying to sell all kinds of wares, he pulls out an old oil lamp, claiming it \"once changed the course of a young man\\'s life. A young man who like this lamp was more than what he seemed; a diamond, in the rough.\"\\n\\nThe peddler then begins to tell the tale, beginning on a dark night, where the Sultan\\'s grand vizier, Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), has a secret meeting with a thief named Kassim. Kassim hands over half a golden scarab beetle, of which Jafar already possess the other half. Putting both halves together, the golden scarab beetle comes to life and flies off into the night, followed by Jafar and Kassim. The golden bug then settles on a sand dune which turns into a giant sand tiger with its mouth wide opened; the Cave of Wonders.\\n\\nJafar orders Kassim to enter the cave and retrieve a lamp. However, upon approaching the cave, the tiger\\'s head speaks that only one may enter: \"One whose worth lies far within; the diamond in the rough!\" Kassim still attempts to enter but as soon as he takes one step inside the tiger\\'s mouth, it bites down on the thief, killing him instantly and closing off the entrance way. The golden scarab beetle then turns back into both halves which Jafar collects. It is then that Jafar understands he needs to find this diamond in the rough in order to enter.\\n\\nThe next day, on the streets of Agrabah, a young street urchin named Aladdin (Scott Weinger) is struggling to steal a loaf of bread, along with his pet monkey, Abu. After outwitting some of the city guards, the two settle down to eat their spoils, but ends up giving it away to a couple of hungry kids struggling to find any food. They are then distracted when a Royal Prince marches through the streets, en route to the Sultan\\'s palace to claim the Princess\\'s hand. Aladdin gets into a confrontation with the prince when he tries to punish two kids who mistakenly walked in front of his horse, causing it to stop abruptly. The prince kicks Alladin into a puddle of dirt and declares Aladdin to be nothing but \"a worthless street rat.\" Aladdin and Abu then retire to their abode, with Aladdin promising his monkey friend that someday, things will be better.\\n\\nThe next day, the prince leaves the palace, angered that Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) has fended off his advances, allowing her pet tiger Raja to rip out the suitor\\'s pant.The Sultan (Douglas Seale) talks to his daughter, who says she is tired of living her life being cooped up behind walls. The Sultan consults with his adviser, Jafar, who claims he can help the Sultan, if the Sultan will give him his blue diamond ring. Using hypnosis on the Sultan, Jafar gets the ring, and retreats to his private quarters.\\n\\nLater on that evening, Jasmine escapes from the palace, and wanders the streets of Agrabah the next day. However, her act of giving an apple to a hungry little boy lands her in trouble with the street merchant she took if from, not realizing she would\\'ve to pay for it. Luckily, Aladdin interferes and cons the merchant into believing he got his apple back. He then leads Jasmine away from the market and away from further trouble.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Jafar has used the blue diamond ring he stole from the Sultan to consult the Sands of Time, which revealed just who he needs to enter the Cave of Wonders: Aladdin.\\n\\nAladdin has retreated with Jasmine to his and Abu\\'s place, and she is rather taken by his kindness. However, Aladdin is suddenly attacked and captured by the city Guards. Jasmine reveals herself to them, demanding Aladdin be released but the head of the Royal Guards, Razoul, tells her he is acting under orders from Jafar.\\n\\nReturning to the Palace, Jasmine confronts Jafar, who explains that Aladdin was captured because he kidnapped her. When Jasmine reveals she escaped the palace on her own and Aladdin had nothing to do with it, Jafar shockingly claims that Aladdin has already been executed, sending her away in tears.\\n\\nIn actuality, Aladdin has been imprisoned in the Royal dungeons. Abu manages to free Aladdin, but they are interrupted by an older prisoner, claiming he needs Aladdin\\'s help to locate the Cave of Wonders. In truth the prisoner is actually Jafar in disguise, who manages to help Aladdin escape the dungeons.\\n\\nAfter the small group arrives at the Cave of Wonders, Aladdin is allowed to enter, with the cave warning him not to touch anything but the lamp. Aladdin and Abu venture deep into the cavern which is filled with many treasures of gold, jewelries, gems and all kind of luxuries, where they first encounter a sentient magic carpet that leads them to the lamp\\'s location. Aladdin is able to retrieve the lamp, but Abu breaks the rule, and picks up a large ruby, causing the cave to begin to collapse on them. Using the magic carpet, Aladdin and Abu manage to get to the entrance of the cave, where the old beggar pleads for Aladdin to give him the lamp. Aladdin does so, and the beggar then reveals a dagger, intending to kill him. Luckily, Abu bites the beggar, and both Aladdin and Abu fall back into the cavern, as the giant Tiger\\'s Head disappears under the sand once again.\\n\\nJafar then laughingly reaches for the lamp, only to find it is gone. Abu managed to steal it off the beggar before he fell back into the cave with Aladdin. Deep within the cave, Aladdin begins to examine the lamp, finding a worn inscription on the side of it. Rubbing it, the lamp then produces a large blue genie. The genie (Robin Williams) tells Aladdin that for rubbing the lamp, he is entitled to three wishes (and that wishing for more wishes is also not an option), but warns that they come with the following exceptions:\\n\\n1) He can\\'t kill anyone. 2) He can\\'t make anyone fall in love with someone else. 3) He can\\'t bring people back from the dead.\\n\\nUsing his street-smarts, Aladdin manages to con Genie into getting them out of the cave without using a wish. Landing in a small oasis, Aladdin contemplates what to wish for, and asks the Genie what he would wish for. The Genie mentions how he\\'d wish to be free of the lamp, prompting Aladdin to promise to free the Genie with his last wish.\\n\\nAs the topic turns to Aladdin\\'s wishes, he thinks of wanting to be with Jasmine, and though he cannot make her fall in love with him, he decides to wish to become a prince, as she is a princess, thus allowing him to at least try to be with her. Aladdin uses his first wish; the genie will turn him into a fabulously rich prince. Abu is transformed into a large elephant and will be Aladdin\\'s mount.\\n\\nMeanwhile, back in Agrabah, Jafar is still upset that he didn\\'t get the lamp. Wanting to find some way to attain power, Jafar attempts to convince the Sultan that there is a clause in the Royal rules that if Jasmine has not been suitably wed by a certain time, she is to marry the great vizier to save faces. The Sultan is reluctant to proceed so Jafar attempts to hypnotize him but he is interrupted by loud music coming from outside.\\n\\nOutside, a large and noisy Royal procession enters the Kingdom, announcing the arrival of Prince Ali Ababwa (aka Aladdin). The procession is huge, with riches, exotic animals, hundreds of servants and Aladdin himself riding an elephant (Abu). Aladdin\\'s entourage makes its way into the palace, impressing the Sultan. Jafar is suspicious and cold toward the new suitor. Aladdin is the taken to Jasmine, who is unimpressed and rebuffs Aladdin\\'s pompous ways. However, when Aladdin removes his hat to shoo away Raja, Jasmine is reminded of the street urchin. Aladdin tries to gain Jasmine\\'s interest again by telling her how rich and powerful he is but she remains steadfastly ambivalent. Aladdin decides to leave Jasmine and steps off on his magic carpet which definitely gets her attention. Jasmine wishes to ride with him and the two take a long trip around the world. Aladdin drops his pompous facade during the trip which eventually wins her over.\\n\\nReturning Jasmine to the palace, Aladdin is roughly seized by palace guards who tie him up and dump him in a nearby lake under orders from Jafar. When he accidentally rubs the lamp, Genie appears and coaxes Aladdin into using his second wish to save the boy\\'s life. Aladdin returns to the palace to find that Jafar is using his cobra-shaped staff to once again to hypnotize the Sultan, demanding that he order his daughter to marry the treacherous vizier. Aladdin figures out Jafar\\'s schemes and smashes the staff. Jafar vanishes before the palace guards can arrest him, but not before spotting the lamp hidden inside Prince Ali\\'s hat. After he\\'s gone, the Sultan sees that Jasmine has accepted Aladdin and wishes to marry him.\\n\\nHowever, Aladdin is still troubled by the fact that he\\'s not a real prince and has been lying to the princess. Genie appears and tries to coax Aladdin into using his last wish to free him. Aladdin tells him he can\\'t free the Genie as he wouldn\\'t be the prince that he is without him, convinced he would lose Jasmine if he\\'s proven not to be a prince. The Genie suddenly retreats into the lamp, feeling angry and betrayed.\\n\\nJafar returns to his secret lair beneath the palace, seemingly defeated but laughing hysterically when he realizes who Prince Ali really is. He then sends his pet parrot Iago (Gilbert Gottfried) to steal the lamp which he does rather easily. Jafar summons the Genie. Genie is forced to do Jafar\\'s bidding and appears in a gigantic form, grabbing the palace and taking it to a remote mountain. Jafar uses his first wish to become the world\\'s most powerful sorcerer and reveals to everyone that Aladdin is nothing but a street urchin. He launches him out of the palace in a makeshift rocket which lands in a snowy cold mountain region. Jafar then uses his second wish to become Sultan and imprisons the Sultan and the princess until she agrees to marry him.\\n\\nTrapped in the mountains, Aladdin finds Abu and the magic carpet and is able to return to Agrabah, sneaking into the palace. He finds the Genie, who warns him he can\\'t help him since Jafar holds the lamp. Aladdin tries to sneak up on Jafar to steal back the lamp. Jasmine sees Aladdin\\'s plan and uses Jafar\\'s wish for her to be in love with him as an excuse to pretend being suddenly enraptured with Jafar to distract him. However, Jafar sees Aladdin\\'s reflection in Jasmine\\'s tiara and knocks him away. He then traps Jasmine in a large hourglass where she will eventually be submerged in sand and die. Jafar transforms himself into a giant cobra to terrorize Aladdin, who fights back valiantly. While trapped in Snake Jafar\\'s coils, Aladdin has an epiphany and cons Jafar into using his third wish: telling Jafar that no matter how powerful he gets, the Genie will still be more powerful. Jafar falls for the ruse and wishes to be turned into a genie himself, which Genie complies. Jafar then changes form which frees Aladdin so he can run to Jasmine\\'s hourglass and break her out before she suffocates. As Jafar revels in his newfound power, Aladdin reminds him that being a Genie also means becoming a servant to whomever holds the lamp. Jafar is suddenly shackled and is sucked into the new lamp created by his wish and is trapped.\\n\\nGenie takes the Jafar lamp and throws it out into the desert, where it lands in the Cave of Wonders as the new lamp. The genie then tells Aladdin that if he wants to use his third wish to become a prince again he can. Aladdin, however, wishes the genie free. The lamp becomes inactive and the genie\\'s shackles fall off his wrists. Overjoyed that he\\'s no longer a servant, the Genie plans to travel the world. The Sultan, knowing that Aladdin is not a prince, decides to let him marry his daughter after seeing how much Aladdin and Jasmine care for each other. Abu is changed back into his monkey form and the Genie leaves after an emotional goodbye. Aladdin and the princess are married and Aladdin becomes heir to the kingdom. They fly away on Aladdin\\'s carpet toward the moon, which turns into the laughing genie\\'s face.\\n\\nSuddenly the film is lifted up by the Genie who says \"Made ya look!!\".', \"&#12302;&#28779;&#22402;&#12427;&#12398;&#22675;&#12303;\\n\\nThe date is September 25th, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. A young boy sits against a pillar at Sannomiya Station, dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor removes his body and digs through his possessions, finding nothing but a candy tin containing ashes and a few fragments of bone which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin springs the spirit of the young boy followed by his little sister along with a cloud of fireflies. The spirit of the young boy, Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi, English: J. Robert Spencer), narrates the story of how he and his sister, Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi, English: Rhoda Chrosite), fared in the wake of the firebombings of Kobe during the war.\\n\\n14-year-old Seita and 4-year-old Setsuko live with their mother (Yoshiko Shinohara), English: Veronica Taylor) comfortably in Kobe while their father serves as a captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy. One day, air raid sirens go off as a fleet of American B-29 Superfortress bombers flies overhead. The children's mother, who suffers from a heart condition, puts Setsuko in the care of her older brother and instructs him to secure the home while she goes ahead to a bomb shelter. Hundreds of incendiary bombs are dropped on the city and most of the civilians are caught off-guard. Seita and Setsuko manage to survive the bombing unscathed and go in search of their mother. They find her at a makeshift clinic set up within a school, horribly burnt and covered head to foot with bloody bandages. She dies a short time later and is cremated in a mass grave with other casualties.\\n\\nDespite their loss, Seita is determined to care for Setsuko and protect her at all costs. They travel to the home of their aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi, English: Amy Jones) who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living there, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing and gives them all to his aunt, however, he keeps one tin of fruit drops for himself. The children's aunt becomes increasingly bitter due to the hardships brought on by the war. She becomes resentful of the children as food rations shrink and she accuses Seita on having done nothing to earn the food she cooks. Tired of his aunt's insults, Seita decides to leave with Setsuko and care for her on his own. They find refuge inside an abandoned bomb shelter and release fireflies within for light. Come morning, Setsuko is horrified to find that all the fireflies have died. She creates a grave for them in the dirt and Seita realizes the depth of her understanding when she asks him why their mother had to die too.\\n\\nThe children soon run out of rice and food and, unable to find work or other means, Seita is forced to steal from local farmers' homes during air raids. When he is caught, he comes to terms with his desperation and takes an increasingly ill Setsuko to a doctor. The doctor informs Seita that his sister is suffering from malnutrition but offers no help. Desperate, Seita withdraws all of the money remaining in his mother's bank account, hoping that it will be enough to treat Setsuko or buy food. As he leaves the bank he becomes distraught when he learns from a nearby crowd that Japan has surrendered to the Allied Forces. Not only that, but he finds that the ship his father captained has been sunk along with most of the Imperial Navy. His father, who had once promised him that Japan could never be defeated. Seita returns to the bomb shelter with a heavy heart and large quantities of food only to find Setsuko lying on the ground, hallucinating and trying to encourage Seita to eat little rocks that she thinks are rice balls. Seita hurries to prepare some food and gets Setsuko to try a bit of watermelon. She thanks him and, exhausted, closes her eyes. She never wakes up.\\n\\nUsing supplies donated to him by a local farmer, Seita prepares a pyre and cremates his sister's body. He places her ashes in the fruit drop tin which he keeps with him beside a picture of their father. A few weeks later, he finds himself in Sannomiya Station and dies of starvation. Illuminated by fireflies, the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen together, healthy and happy, as they look down on the modern city of Kobe.\", 'In St Petersburg, Russia, in 1916, a lavish ball is held to celebrate 300 years of the ruling of the Romanov family. Attending the event is the Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury), whose son Nicolas is the Tsar of Imperial Russia. At the event, Marie is happy to see her granddaughter Anastasia (Kirsten Dunst), who is sad that Marie will be going to Paris, France. Marie has chosen to give Anastasia a music box as a gift, which plays a melody that both of them know. The wind-up key to make the music box work is on a pendant, inscribed with the words, \"Together in Paris.\"\\n\\nThe mood of the party is soon silenced as Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) enters, claiming to be Nicolas\\' \"confidant.\" Nicolas instead brands Rasputin as a traitor, and orders him out of the Palace. Angered at Nicholas, Rasputin claims that he and his family will be dead within the fortnight, and vows to not rest until all the Romanovs are dead.\\n\\nRasputin then sells his soul for the power to destroy the Romanov family. With his stronger dark powers, Rasputin uses them to cause dissent among the people, who soon revolt and charge the Palace gates. Anastasia and Marie are in a room in the midst of the chaos, but escape through a secret entrance with the help of a servant boy. As they attempt to make their way across a frozen river on the Palace Grounds, Rasputin confronts them, but ends up on thin ice, which cracks and gives way under him, causing him to sink into the cold waters, leaving behind his magic reliquary and a little fruitbat named Bartok (Hank Azaria).\\n\\nAnastasia and Marie attempt to board a train, but in the process, Anastasia loses her grip on Marie\\'s hand, falling to the platform, where she hits her head and goes unconscious.\\n\\n10 years after the revolution, St Petersburg is filled with gossip that Anastasia (Meg Ryan) may still be alive, with the Dowager Empress Marie (who still resides in Paris) promising to pay a reward for the return of her granddaughter. A conman in St Petersburg named Dimitri (John Cusack) and his assistant Vlad (Kelsey Grammer) are attempting to find a woman to pass off as Anastasia, in hopes of bilking Marie out of the reward.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Anastasia has grown up in an orphanage, under the name of Anya. Having developed amnesia after falling off the train onto the platform, no memory of her past life remains, except for the key/locket to the music box. The head of the orphanage has deemed it time for Anya to go to work, and sends her off to work at a fish factory. Anya soon comes to a fork in the road, with one way leading to the town where the fish factory is, and the other leading to St. Petersburg. Unsure which way to go, Anya is surprised when a little puppy appears, and seems to lead her to St. Petersburg.\\n\\nOnce there, she attempts to take a train to Paris, but is denied transit because she does not have an exit visa. A woman who hears this tells Anya to see a man named Dimitri, who she claims can help her. Anya is informed that Dimitri can be found near the now-abandoned Royal Palace, and soon enters. Once inside, she is overcome by various memories, as she enters the now-dusty grand ballroom.\\n\\nSuddenly, a voice rings out, and Anya finds herself face-to-face with Dimitri and Vlad. Looking at her, Dimitri feels that Anya would be perfect for his plans, and convinces Anya that he can help her get to Paris if she will accompany him and Vlad to see the Dowager Empress and see if she may really be the missing Anastasia Romanov. Naturally, Anya goes along with the plan, having no knowledge of who she really is.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in a little alcove of the ballroom, Bartok has been hiding, and notices that Rasputin\\'s reliquary has started to glow. As he lays a hand on it, it suddenly rockets the little bat into \\'limbo,\\' where Rasputin has been for 10 years. Since Anastasia survived, he was not able to die completely, and has been stuck in limbo as a rotting corpse. When Bartok presents him with the reliquary, Rasputin uses its powers to conjure minions to destroy Anastasia.\\n\\nAnya, Dimitri, and Vlad board a train headed to Paris, but end up having to hide in the baggage car when their passports\\' coloration is overheard to not match the proper color. Rasputin\\'s minions also intend to derail the train, but our group manages to escape before it plunges into a canyon.\\n\\nThey continue on foot, with Vlad telling of the Dowager Empress\\' first cousin, Sophie (Bernadette Peters), who questions anyone claiming to be Anastasia. Anya gets indignant that no one told her she had to prove she was Anastasia. Vlad convinces her that there\\'s nothing for her back in Russia, and that Paris could hold something special. His words convince her, and they begin going over proper etiquette and Romanov history.\\n\\nEventually, they take a ship from Germany to Paris, where both Dimitri and Anya perform a waltz, which seems to bring the two a bit closer together. That evening, Rasputin invades Anya\\'s dream, and causes her to almost sleepwalk over the edge of the boat, until Dimitri saves her.\\n\\nAfter the two setbacks, Rasputin decides he will return to the living world and deal with Anastasia himself. Bartok reluctantly follows.\\n\\nAnya, Dimitri and Vlad eventually make it to Paris, unaware that the Dowager Empress has had enough of the various impostors claiming to be her granddaughter, and decides to forgo the search.\\n\\nJust moments after this decision, Anya and the others arrive at the Empress\\' mansion, and Sophie answers the door. Even though she has been privy to the Empress\\' wishes, she still questions Anya. Eventually, the questioning turns to just how Anastasia was able to escape from the Palace. Dmitri thinks that they will be found out, but is shocked when Anya explains that a young boy opened a secret passage for her and the Empress to escape through.\\n\\nSophie explains that Anya appears to have answered all the questions correctly, but explains about Marie\\'s wishes to not see anyone else. Vlad insists that Marie meet Anya, and Sophie hints that Marie will be attending a performance of the Russian Ballet that night. Sophie then takes the three of them shopping for new clothes.\\n\\nLater that evening, Dimitri takes Vlad aside, and explains that with the escape story that Anya told, he is sure that their intended impostor is the real Anastasia, telling Vlad that he was that boy in her story. However, their talk is interrupted as Anya arrives, and they go to their box in the Opera Hall.\\n\\nDuring the intermission, Dimitri and Anya go to the Empress\\' private box, where Sophie allows Dimitri to meet with the Empress. However, Marie explains that she\\'s heard about Dmitri, and knows about his schemes to deceive her. Dimitri is thrown out, having failed to see that the door to the box was partially open, and Anya heard the entire conversation. Dimitri tries to explain who she really is, but she storms off and heads back to their residence.\\n\\nDimitri waits until Marie leaves the Opera House, and then takes the place of her chauffeur, driving her to Anya\\'s residence, and demanding Marie see her. Marie still refuses, until Dimitri produces the music box that she had given Anastasia long before (the music box was left behind after Marie and Anastasia escaped through the secret door).\\n\\nMarie then gives into Dimitri\\'s wish, and talks to Anya. Anya explains that all she wants is to find where she belongs. As they talk, Anya shows Marie the locket she has, and when Marie produces the music box, Anya\\'s memory fully returns, and Marie is overjoyed that she has found her granddaughter again.\\n\\nMarie eventually calls on Dimitri, presenting him with the reward, and her gratitude. Even so, Dimitri refuses the reward, but is glad to see that he has reunited Anastasia with her true family. As he leaves, he encounters Anastasia, and the two exchange few words, with Anastasia believing that Dimitri got his reward after all.\\n\\nLater on that evening, Marie and Anastasia are in attendance at a social function in Paris, in which Anastasia will be revealed to those in attendance. Marie explains that her granddaughter should be happy, but she seems somewhat distant. Marie knows that Anastasia secretly loves Dimitri, and explains to her that he did not take the reward. Marie goes out to join the festivities first, telling Anastasia that whatever path she chooses should make her happy.\\n\\nAfter Marie leaves, Anastasia is distracted by her puppy, which leads her out into the garden near the building. As she makes her way to a nearby bridge, Rasputin emerges from the fog, and attempts to kill her. However, Dimitri (having had second thoughts) returns to try and save Anastasia. In the process, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin\\'s reliquary, and destroy it, causing the \\'mad monk\\' to finally be destroyed.\\n\\nIn the aftermath, Anastasia and Dimitri confess their feelings for the other, and elope, with Anastasia choosing to forgo her royal heritage for love, much to the delight of her grandmother, who declares it a \"perfect beginning\" for the two young lovers.', 'The wizard Vitruvius attempts to protect the \"Kragle\", a superweapon, from the evil Lord Business.

Bad Cop tracks down Emmet and Wyldstyle, who are rescued by her boyfriend, Batman. He takes them to a meeting of the remaining Master Builders. Unimpressed with Emmet, they refuse to fight Lord Business. Bad Cop and his forces attack and capture all the Master Builders except for Emmet and a few others. Emmet believes the Master Builders\\' weakness is that their individual creativity prevents them from working together. He devises a team plan to infiltrate Lord Business\\' headquarters. As Emmet and his allies are captured and imprisoned, Vitruvius attempts to fight back but is killed; with his dying words he admits the prophecy was made up. Business throws the Piece of Resistance off the edge of the universe, sets his headquarters to self-destruct, and leaves with the Kragle while leaving Bad Cop behind. Vitruvius\\' ghost tells Emmet that even if the prophecy isn\\'t real, Emmet can still save the world. Emmet, tied to the self-destruct mechanism\\'s battery, sacrifices himself for his friends, flinging himself off the edge of the universe.\\n\\nInspired, the Master Builders escape and rally with the help of Bad Cop. Soon, Lego people across the universe are building their own creative weapons. The Master Builders lead the charge against Business.\\n\\nEmmet finds himself in the real world, where the events of the story are being played out within the imagination of a boy, Finn. His father \"The Man Upstairs\" chastises his son for ruining his father\\'s Lego set by mixing characters with the wrong playsets, and originating hodgepodge creations. Finn argues that Lego are for children, but his father prefers to Krazy Glue his perceived perfect creations together permanently, as this is how adults play with Lego. In the Lego world, Lord Business\\' forces gain the upper hand. Realizing the father will glue all the Lego in place, Emmet wills himself to move and falls off the table, gaining Finn\\'s attention. Finn returns Emmet to the Lego set, where Emmet builds a massive robot to assist his friends before confronting Lord Business. In the real world, Finn\\'s father looks at his son\\'s creations again and finds himself impressed. Realizing his son based the evil Lord Business on him, the father has a change of heart and allows his son to play with his Lego however he sees fit. In the Lego world, Emmet convinces Lord Business that Business, too, is special, as is everyone. Moved by Emmet\\'s speech, Business destroys the Kragle and unfreezes his victims.\\n\\nWith the world saved, Emmet celebrates with his friends, and Wyldstyle, whose real name is Lucy, becomes his girlfriend. However, alien Duplo beings beam down, announcing their intentions to invade, due to the father allowing Finn\\'s little sister to play with his Lego set as well. Then at the end they get captured by the Duplo toys', 'In Ancient Egypt, Hebrew slaves are hard at work making bricks and setting up giant statues and other monuments. Through song, it is implied that they call on their God regularly, seeking deliverance from their slavery, under which they have labored for hundreds of years. On this particular day, while the men are toiling on one side of the Nile River, on the other side their homes are raided by soldiers in the Egyptian army. They take infant boys from their mothers by force and kill them. However, a Hebrew woman, Yocheved, steals away to the river with her baby and her two older children, where she sets the baby adrift in a reed basket--hoping and praying this will save her son. The reed basket makes a tumultuous journey down the river among both dangerous animals and large boats--with several close calls. Eventually, it makes its way to the Pharaoh\\'s palace, where his wife and young son, Rameses, play with a lotus flower. The Queen finds and opens the basket. She looks at the baby with love and compassion, chooses to keep him, and names him Moses. Moses\\' sister, Miriam, having followed the basket, sees this and prays that someday Moses will come back to deliver them from slavery.\\n\\nMany years later (about twenty years, give or take), Moses and Rameses have become rather reckless young men, much to the disdain of their father, Pharaoh Seti. Moses in particular has a tendency for troublemaking; Rameses in turn often finds himself entangled in his brother\\'s foolish behavior, though he is generally more serious. After damaging a temple that was under renovation through an especially foolhardy chariot race, Pharaoh reprimands his sons--especially Rameses since he is next in line for the throne. When Rameses angrily says that one ruined temple won\\'t undo centuries of tradition, Seti retorts \"But one weak link can break the chain of a mighty dynasty!\" After he\\'s dismissed, Rameses leaves in indignation and shame. Moses asks Pharaoh why he is so hard on Rameses, especially since he knows Moses is the most responsible for the damage. He replies that since Rameses is the next Pharaoh, he needs to be trained to never turn away from his responsibilities and traditions, even if Moses is the one trying to lead him astray. Moses declares his confidence in Rameses\\' seriousness and devotion, and informs Seti that he just needs an opportunity to prove himself.\\n\\nMoses finds Rameses sulking over his father\\'s words. He attempts to comfort him by sarcastically pointing out how it would be impossible for one man, even a Pharaoh, to ruin the Egyptian empire. Rameses resists his efforts at first, but eventually gives in. Moses points out in jest that Rameses\\' problem is that he cares too much. Without missing a beat, Rameses says Moses\\' problem is that he doesn\\'t care at all. Moses replies \"Oh, so I suppose you care more than I do that we\\'re... late for the banquet for example?\" Panicking, Rameses runs to the banquet hall with Moses right behind. Moses assures him that no one will notice them enter... until everyone notices them enter. The large hall is filled with people. Fortunately, their timing is perfect, because (as their mother, the Queen, whispers to them) Pharaoh Seti had just named Rameses as Prince Regent. Pharaoh had taken Moses\\' advice to heart.\\n\\nMoses proposes to Seti that the high priests, Hotep and Huy (who dislike the two brothers), should offer tribute to their new regent. He agrees, and the two priests decide to offer a beautiful young woman named Tzipporah [the T is silent], a Midianite slave girl who had been captured recently. Though they refer to her as a delicate, desert flower, she proves to be anything but gentle. Afraid (at first) and angry, she nearly bites Rameses\\' hand when he gets far too close--so he offers her to Moses instead. Though he tries to decline (as Rameses pushes him towards her), she also defies him and insults him. Rameses laughs and asks \"Are you going to let her talk to you like that?\" Moses responds by warning her to show the proper respect for a prince of Egypt. She replies \"But I am showing you all the respect you deserve... NONE!\" She yanks the rope tied to her wrists from Hotep\\'s hands, but Moses grabs the rope before she can attempt to escape. She pulls as hard as she can and demands to be set free. Noticing an indoor pond behind her, Moses says \"As you wish\" and lets go abruptly--causing her to trip and fall into it. The whole room erupts into laughter, except for the Queen who turns her face away in shame. Moses sees this and stops laughing, ashamed that he disappointed his mother.\\n\\nAfter ordering a nearby servant to send Tzipporah to Moses\\' chambers, Rameses declares \"If it pleases you Father, my first act as Regent is to appoint Moses as Royal Chief Architect!\" As he says this, he takes a blue scarab ring from his hand and gives it to Moses. The hall congratulates him with cheers and applause, but as he inspects the ring with gratitude, he notices Tzipporah on her way out--glaring at him intensely. It is clear from his facial expression that Moses is not looking forward to that night with her.\\n\\nAfter the banquet ends, Moses nervously enters his room. Seeing someone seated on his bed behind a curtain, he composes himself and pulls it back. It turns out to be a servant; Tzipporah had tied him up thoroughly (and also Moses\\' dogs) and had escaped out the open balcony by using several bedsheets tied together. He sees her sneaking out quietly with a camel and supplies. As he climbs down the sheet-rope, he notices a couple of guards about to cross paths with her. He calls to them, getting their attention, while Tzipporah stops in her tracks. However, instead of having the guards recapture her (he can see her standing behind them by this point), he tells them about the man tied up in his room and orders them to investigate. This surprises Tzipporah, but she runs while Moses watches the guards leave. He follows her as she leaves the palace and travels through the Hebrew settlements. She asks and is given water by a man and a woman at a well near the outer edge of the settlements. She thanks them and escapes into the desert on the camel.\\n\\nWhen Moses goes to watch Tzipporah leave (clearly captivated by her), the Hebrew woman recognizes him. She says that she is his sister, Miriam, and that the man (named Aaron) is his brother. She assumes that he knows they are his older siblings, and that he has come to see them at last. Aaron tries to prevent Miriam from speaking to Moses, because he can see that Moses has no idea who they are and would end up punishing them for these assertions. He does this by claiming that Miriam is delusional, first because of fatigue from their daily labors (not that it was too much; they quite enjoyed it), and then later because she is mentally ill. Miriam angrily denies these claims and insists that Moses is their brother. Moses is incensed at her words, but Miriam relates how their mother, Yocheved, set him adrift in a basket on the Nile River to save his life. Confused, he asks from whom. She answers \"Ask the man that you call Father!\" Truly angered by this, he approaches her as she claims that God chose him to deliver the Hebrews out of slavery. He grabs her arm and throws her to the ground, saying \"You will regret this night.\"\\n\\nDespairing, Miriam starts to sing Yocheved\\'s lullaby to Moses that she sang as she set him in the basket. Walking away, Moses stops because he begins to recognize the song (he had been whistling the tune the previous day). As he turns back around to look at Miriam, he realizes that she was telling the truth. Shocked from hearing this, Moses runs back to the palace in denial. As he attempts to convince himself that this is his true home, and it\\'s all he ever wanted, he falls asleep. He has a nightmare (or possibly a vision) showing what happened the day of which Miriam spoke, including the deaths of the Hebrew infants--thrown into the Nile River to drown and be eaten by crocodiles.\\n\\nWhen Moses wakes in horror, he searches the palace for evidence of this terrible event. It is still night. Eventually, he finds a large relief mural with hieroglyphics showing and declaring the death of the Hebrew baby boys--by the command of the man he called Father. Presumably having been awakened by the torchlight passing through the halls, Pharaoh Seti approaches him and explains that this was an unwilling precaution on his part to keep the slaves from over-multiplying and uprising. He says \"Moses, sometimes... for the greater good... sacrifices must be made.\" Because Moses is clearly saddened and disturbed, Seti attempts to comfort him and justify himself, saying \"They were only slaves.\" However, because of his newfound knowledge of his Hebrew origins, this drives Moses away from him for good. He leaves Seti\\'s embrace and runs out into the night.\\n\\nEarly that morning, Moses\\' adopted mother finds him sitting by the river where she found him in the basket all those years ago. Confronting her about his origins, he says sadly \"So everything I thought... everything I am... is a lie.\" She responds \"No! You are our son, and we love you.\" Asking why she took him in, she says she didn\\'t. She expresses her belief that he was truly sent by the gods, saying \"Here the river brought you, and it\\'s here the river meant to be your home.\" She embraces him, hoping to comfort and reassure him of their love for him.\\n\\nHowever, as Rameses presents his new renovation plan to the high priests for the temple he and Moses ruined the previous day, Moses is still deeply unsettled. He is only paying attention to the Hebrews, as if noticing them and their sufferings for the first time. He is especially racked with guilt because they are cleaning up the destruction he caused. As he sadly watches them, he soon observes one of them being whipped violently and repeatedly. It is an old man who is having difficulty with his heavy burdens. He notices Miriam and Aaron working near the man, with Aaron holding her back from trying to interfere. Here Moses fully accepts who he is, and being moved with anger and pain, he runs to stop the cruel overseer from beating the man. But in the process, he ends up knocking the overseer off a high scaffold to his death. Horrified by what he has done, and being witnessed by many (including Rameses and the high priests), Moses begins to run. The Hebrews stand back in fear, except for Miriam who calls his name and takes his arm to calm him down--but he pulls it away and keeps running.\\n\\nHe is intercepted by Rameses, who grabs him and asks him what\\'s going on. However, he pushes him aside and continues to run. He nearly makes it out of the city before Rameses catches up to him on his chariot. Moses exclaims \"You saw what happened--I just killed a man!\" Rameses claims he will \"make it so it never happened.\" However, Moses refuses to accept any more lies about his life. Because of his disgust at both his killing of the overseer and his past unconcern towards the slaves, and because he knew he has neither power nor moral authority to free the slaves, he ignores Rameses\\' pleas. He tells Rameses he can no longer remain in Egypt. When Rameses attempts to stop him, Moses grabs his shoulders and shouts \"No! Everything I\\'ve ever known to be true is a lie!...I\\'m not who you think I am.\" Asking what he means by that, Moses simply answers \"Go ask the man I once called Father.\" Turning to leave, Moses stops when his brother pleads with him to remain. But Moses only says \"Goodbye, brother,\" and runs--with Rameses calling his name.\\n\\nMoses wanders far into the desert. After several days, famished from lack of food and water, he stubs his toe and breaks his sandal. He angrily discards them and the rest of his royal ornaments, except for the ring given to him by Rameses. A sandstorm soon overtakes him, and he surrenders himself to it. However, he survives; a camel pulls his head out of the sand (thinking his hair was grass). He notices the camel is saddled and holds a water pouch. He digs himself out hastily and tries to take some of the water, but he only has enough energy to loop his arm around the pouch before passing out. Fortunately, the camel drags him to a large well with some troughs, where he gorges himself on the liquid goodness within--much to the surprise of a nearby sheep. Soon after he arrives, Moses observes some bandits attempting to steal water from three young girls. Moses manages to drive the bandits away by sending their camels on the run, but in his exhaustion, he falls down the well by chance. The three girls turn out to be Tzipporah\\'s younger sisters, who are unable to get Moses out of the well until she comes along. Thinking they are only playing around (after the youngest says they are \"trying to get the funny man out of the well\"), she\\'s surprised to hear him struggling as they attempt to pull him up. She hurriedly informs him they will get him out soon and pulls him up in a few seconds. However, once she realizes it\\'s Moses, she drops him back down the well as retaliation for embarrassing her at the banquet several nights previous. (This is done in relatively good nature, though, as she is aware of his help in her escape; it is assumed that she pulls him back out shortly afterward.) As she swaggers away, her two youngest sisters look to the third one for an explanation; she answers \"This is why Papa says she will never get married...\"\\n\\nThat evening, Tzipporah\\'s father, Jethro the High Priest of Midian, holds a celebration in thanks for what Moses has done. Moses claims that his past actions (and inaction) make him unworthy of any honor (Tzipporah is surprised by his great change in attitude since they first meet). However, Jethro refuses to believe his claim, referring to how Moses helped get all his daughters out of perilous situations. He informs Moses that if he wants to see what his life is worth, he needs to view his life \"through Heaven\\'s eyes\", which he eventually does. Moses grows to become a member of Jethro\\'s tribe, working with Tzipporah and her sisters as a shepherd. Over time, he and Tzipporah become friends, fall in love, and get married.\\n\\nOne day (probably about ten years, give or take, after Moses left Egypt), while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a cavern with a bush that burned in a way he has never seen before, with an unusual fire that didn\\'t scorch. The bush then speaks, revealing that it is the voice and presence of God, who has heard the cries of the Israelites. When Moses nervously asks what is wanted of him, the voice says that He has chosen Moses to deliver the Hebrews out of slavery (just as his sister, Miriam, had declared), by speaking to Pharoah the words which he will be taught to say. Moses is at first apprehensive, given that he was the son of Pharoah, the man who murdered the children of the slaves. However, the voice commands Moses to go forth, promising to smite Egypt with His wonders when Pharaoh will not listen. He promises to be with Moses. Afterwards, God\\'s presence departs, leaving the bush no longer alight. During this conversation, Moses\\' attitude and feelings go from shame and fear, to peace, confidence, and joy.\\n\\nMoses returns to Tzipporah and excitedly informs her of what transpired in the cave, and what he has been asked to do. Since she is overcome at first by the immensity of the task given him, he informs of his desire to see his people free, like her family is free. She lays aside her fears for him and decides to accompany him back to his former home. Upon reaching the palace, Moses finds that his father (and mother, presumably) is dead, and Rameses has become the new Pharoah, married with a son of his own. The two brothers greet each other jovially, with Rameses eager to welcome Moses back, forgiving the events that drove him away (and seemingly ignoring his Hebrew origins). Moses hesitantly explains that things cannot return to how they once were, and requests that Rameses let the slaves go free, as requested by God. Moses then demonstrates God\\'s power, as his wooden staff becomes a snake. Rameses smirks at this trick, but is confused, thinking that Moses has something else he wants to talk about. However, he plays along, and has Hotep and Huy conjure their own magic, which is consists of convincing showmanship. This impresses the rest of Rameses\\' court, but not Moses or Tzipporah.\\n\\nRameses and Moses then meet in private, where they discuss the slaves, the duties of Pharaoh, and the actions of Seti. Frustrated by Rameses\\' refusal to acknowledge the humanity of the slaves, Moses\\' relation to them, and the sins of Seti, Moses declares that he can no longer hide in the desert while his people suffer. He returns the royal ring that Rameses had given him so long ago. Rameses is saddened, then angered, that Moses came back for the Hebrews and not for him. He declares that he does not acknowledge his brother\\'s God, and refuses to allow the Hebrews to leave. Moses pleads for his brother to reconsider, but Rameses claims he will not be the \\'weak link\\' in his family\\'s dynasty, showing that Seti was successful in setting Rameses on an unalterable path. He then orders the workload doubled for the slaves out of spite.\\n\\nSeveral of the slaves--including his brother Aaron--shun Moses because of the extra workload, and they doubt that God called Moses to deliver them (or even cares for them). However, Miriam harbors no grudge towards her brother, claiming that God saved Moses from all his trials and adversity for a purpose. This encourages Moses to not give up. On the Nile River near them, Moses sees Rameses, his son, Hotep, and Huy on a royal barge. Moses approaches them, and shouts for Rameses to let his people go. Rameses scoffs at this, and sends his guards after him--until Moses places his staff in the water, turning the Nile to blood. Unsure how this is achieved, Rameses demands that Hotep and Huy duplicate or explain this. Using some red powder, they claim that the power of their gods can do the same, and Rameses just dismisses Moses\\' trick once again. Aaron claims that nothing will help them, but Moses promises that God will see to it that they are made free.\\n\\nA series of plagues then begin to befall Egypt, each more ferociously destructive than the last: Locusts destroy crops, the Egyptians come down with terrible sores on their skin, and fire rains down from the sky. Even with all these events and several more, which his mages prove powerless to counter, Rameses still refuses to give into Moses\\' request. Meanwhile, he banishes Hotep and Huy from the palace for their deceptions. Moses and Rameses are both frustrated with each other. Many monuments, statues, and structures become damaged or destroyed.\\n\\nSoon after, the land is covered in darkness (except for where the Hebrews live), and Moses goes to see his brother once again to convince him to let the Hebrews go. As they talk, Rameses eventually opens up, they reminisce on their past, and a flicker of mutual brotherly love seems almost rekindled, until Rameses\\' son comes in and demands to know if Moses is the reason for what has befallen Egypt. With his son close by, Rameses once again sheds his friendlier side and acts as Pharaoh. Moses explains that the plagues would end if Rameses would just fulfill his request, and says something even more terrifying will happen if he doesn\\'t, pleading for Rameses to think of his son. Rameses says he does, and proposes that he will \"finish the job\" that his father was not able to do, promising a greater massacre among the slaves than ever before. Horrified at Rameses\\' murderous defiance with this threat to his people, Moses calmly but sadly notes that what is to come will be Rameses\\' responsibility.\\n\\nDisheartened, Moses leaves and instructs the slaves to mark lamb\\'s blood above their doors for protection. He informs them that the firstborn of every household will die, unless the blood is upon the door. In the night, the angel of death comes, and passes over the protected doors. In the homes where there is no protective sign, the angel takes the lives of the firstborn children, including Rameses\\' son. Moses goes to his brother after this, amidst the mourning of the Egyptians, and is at last given permission to take the slaves. He attempts to comfort Rameses, but he orders him to leave the palace.\\n\\nMoses is at first distraught, because of all who have died (among many other things), but Miriam encourages him, saying (or singing, rather) how at long last, the Hebrews (and any who will go with them) are finally having their prayers answered, and their faith affirmed. Tzipporah also tells how her own faith has grown, and the three of them, with Aaron, lead the exodus of the slaves. Most of the people are still somewhat in shock, but as they make their way out of Egypt, their spirits lift. After they finally reach the Red Sea, the watchman\\'s horn is sounded behind them, and they see that Rameses has gathered his army of chariots to kill the slaves out of revenge; there appears to be no place for them to run. Suddenly, a pillar of fire descends from the heavens, separating the Hebrews and Rameses\\' army. Moses then walks a short distance into the Red Sea, and with his staff, parts the waters. At first, the people are afraid to pass through (and probably afraid of Moses also), but having overcome all his previous doubts, Aaron goes forward--encouraging the others to do likewise.\\n\\nThe slaves make their way through, but eventually, the pillar of fire disappears, and Rameses and his men decide to ride through the parted sea, rather than turn back and acknowledge defeat. Moses is able to get everyone across just as the water descends, drowning Rameses\\' army. Meanwhile, Rameses is washed back ashore on the other side. The people are shocked by what happened for several moments, but eventually, they realize that they are finally free, and they begin to celebrate. Moses begins to celebrate with his family, but then turns back to look across the sea, and thinks of his brother Rameses. Knowing that they will never see each other again, he quietly says goodbye one last time. Meanwhile, Rameses is conscious, and crying out Moses\\' name in rage, despair, and regret.\\n\\nAs the Hebrews continue on their way, Tzipporah declares to Moses that they are free, thus reminding him that he accomplished the seemingly impossible task that God had given him. He acknowledges this with joy. The final scene shows Moses descending from Mount Horeb (Sinai) holding two stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments which God has given them to live by.', 'Joe Gardner, a middle school music teacher, feels stuck in life and unfulfilled at his job. He dreams of a career in jazz, to which his seamstress mother, Libba, objects. By chance, his former student Curly informs him of an opening in the band of jazz legend Dorothea Williams. Joe impresses Dorothea with his piano playing and is offered the job on the spot. As Joe happily heads off to prepare for his first performance later that night, he falls down a manhole.\\n\\nJoe finds himself as a soul heading into the \"Great Beyond\". Unwilling to die before his big break, he tries to escape but ends up in the \"Great Before\", where soul counselors-all named Jerry-prepare unborn souls for life on Earth. Joe poses as an instructor who is set to train the souls and is assigned 22, a cynical soul who has remained in the Great Before for millennium and sees no point in living on Earth. 22 reveals that she has a badge that fills up with traits. She needs to find her \"spark\" to complete it and says she will give it to Joe so that he can return home.\\n\\nJoe tries to assist 22 in finding a passion, but the attempts prove futile. With no other options, 22 takes him out to \"the zone\", an area that people enter when their passion sets them into a euphoric trance; it also houses the lost souls who become obsessed. They meet Moonwind, a sign twirler who enters the zone to rescue lost souls. He agrees to help Joe return to his body and they learn that Joe\\'s fall down the manhole sent him into a coma. Joe excitedly hops back to Earth but accidentally brings 22 with him, resulting in 22 entering his body and Joe ending up in the body of a therapy cat. Meanwhile, Terry, an accountant designated to counting souls headed to the Great Beyond, finds the count off and convinces the Jerrys to let her return the missing soul.\\n\\n22 and Joe escape the hospital. Initially frightened, 22 settles into Joe\\'s body and finds great enjoyment in the little things in life. They head to Joe\\'s apartment where Connie, one of Joe\\'s students, arrives to tell him that she is quitting the band. Before leaving, Connie plays a passionate trombone solo, stunning 22, who convinces her of the talent she has and that music is for her. Happy, Connie thanks \"Joe\" and leaves, having changed her mind. They next go to get a haircut where 22 holds a deep, poignant conversation with Dez, the barber. After 22 rips Joe\\'s pants while bending down, the duo go to see Libba to have it fixed; after \"Joe\" reconciles with his mother, Libba finally accepts Joe\\'s passion for music and offers him his late father\\'s old suit.\\n\\nBefore Moonwind can restore Joe, 22, who both experiences an epiphany and decides she must find her purpose on Earth, refuses to proceed with Joe\\'s restoration. As she flees with Joe tailing behind, Terry catches up and brings both back to the Great Before, where 22 sees that her badge has been filled out. However, Joe tells her that his experiences and tastes earned the badge. Angry, 22 tosses the badge at Joe and disappears into the zone. Joe learns from a Jerry that instead of a life\\'s purpose, a spark simply means that a soul is ready to live. He heads back to Earth and has a successful first performance with the Dorothea quartet, but does not feel right about what happened.\\n\\nInspired by the objects 22 collected while in his body, Joe plays the piano to enter the zone and look for 22, who is now a lost soul. He tries to return her badge, but 22 remains hopeless and broken about her purpose. Using a small maple seed that 22 had collected, Joe convinces her that she is ready to live, and she returns to normal. With her badge back, 22 finally enters Earth with Joe accompanying her for as long as he can. As he prepares to head into the Great Beyond, Joe is stopped by a Jerry who tells him that he has inspired them and will give him another chance at life. Joe thanks them and returns to his body back in Earth, now with the intent to live his life to the fullest.', 'When Shrek and Fiona come back from their honeymoon, they find an invitation to a royal ball with Fiona\\'s parents to celebrate their marriage, an event Shrek is reluctant to participate in. Fiona talks him into it, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona\\'s parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are surprised and repulsed by Fiona\\'s choice of husband (particularly the King himself), since they had arranged that Prince Charming rescue her from the castle but now they see that her husband is an ogre.\\n\\nAt a shared meal, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and her father\\'s behaviour, locks herself away in her room that evening, where she meets her Fairy Godmother, who is also surprised at Fiona\\'s new looks.

Puss is unable to defeat Shrek and, revealing that he was paid by Harold, asks to come along as a way to make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother\\'s potion factory and steal a \"Happily Ever After\" potion that Shrek believes will restore Fiona\\'s love for him.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep. The potion also affects Fiona who also faints.

Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him.\\n\\nAs the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek\\'s offer to remain human, and revert back into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal.\\n\\nIn a mid-credits scene: Dragon, who had previously married Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies.', \"In a prologue, we see Lord Fergus and Lady Elinor in a forested area, celebrating the birthday of their young daughter, Merida. Though Elinor happily plays with Merida, she grows perturbed when Fergus gives the little girl her own bow and set of arrows.\\n\\nAs Merida tries to hit a target, one of the arrows sails off into the forest nearby. Merida runs off and retrieves it, but soon encounters a glowing blue willo-the-wisp. Going back to her parents, she tells what she saw, and her mother explains that they can lead a person to their destiny.\\n\\nSuddenly, the mood is broken as an enormous black bear enters the camp grounds. Merida and her mother quickly take leave as Lord Fergus and his men fight against the bear.\\n\\nTime passes, and we see that Lord Fergus has lost his leg to the bear. In the time that has passed, Lady Elinor has given birth to three mischievous boys (triplets), and Merida is now a teenager. While her mother wants her to be proper, Merida is moreso intent on practicing archery, and journeying off in the forest.\\n\\nOne evening, a messenger brings word that the 3 neighboring clans have accepted the offer to fight for Merida's hand in marriage. Naturally, the young woman is not at all happy with this situation. Elinor explains to her daughter that the clans must be kept in harmony, or chaos may reign. She relates the story of how the clans were descended from four brothers, but one of them wanted more power than the others, and caused the balance of power to crumble. Even so, this does little to quell Merida's resentment of the betrothal.\\n\\nThe three clans soon arrive, and Lords MacGuffin, Macintosh, and Dingwall arrive with each of their sons. Per tradition, each of the first-born of the clans will fight in the event that the Princess chooses. This causes Merida to perk up, and she eagerly suggests archery.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the sport, almost none of the sons are good at the sport, but everyone is shocked when Merida appears before everyone, claiming that since she's a first-born as well, she'll be 'fighting for her own hand.' Elinor demands Merida stop, but she defies her mother, and makes a bulls-eye on each of the targets.\\n\\nNaturally, Elinor feels angry and humiliated at this, and both mother and daughter have a heated conversation in her room later on. Merida claims she does not want to be like her mother, and in anger, slashes a tapestry depicting the family, slicing a hole between her and her mother in the piece.\\n\\nUpset by this as well, Elinor loses her temper, and throws Merida's bow in a fireplace nearby. Upset by this, Merida flees the castle. Unseen by Merida, her mother regrets what she has done a few moments later, and manages to retrieve the bow from the fire.\\n\\nMerida flees to the forest, where she comes across a circle of stones, and several willo-the-wisps. Following them, she finds a small cottage inhabited by an old woman. The old woman claims she is just a wood carver, but Merida soon realizes she's actually a witch, when she notices an enchanted broom, and the woman's crow (which can talk!).\\n\\nMerida eagerly asks for a spell to change her mother, but the witch refuses, claiming she did a spell once before, and regretted it. However, Merida gets her to reconsider when she agrees to purchase all her wood carvings. The offer is too much to resist, and the witch brews a concoction that produces a small pie. Merida is instructed to give it to her mother, and she eagerly ruses off to do so.\\n\\nReturning to the castle, King Fergus is doing his best to quell the Lords after the events of the tournament. Merida encounters her mother in the kitchen, and eagerly gives her the pie, but after one bite, Elinor claims she does not feel well.\\n\\nMerida happily leads her to her chambers, but soon her happiness that her mother will change turns to shock...when her mother turns into a black bear!\\n\\nKnowing that King Fergus will surely kill Elinor, Merida enlists the aid of her brothers to distract Fergus and the Lords, while she sneaks her mother out of the castle, and back into the forest.\\n\\nThe two manage to find the witch's hovel, but find it is now empty. A message left for Merida tells that the Witch has gone away until the next Spring, and that the spell will become permanent within 2 sunrises. However, if Merida wants to reverse the effects, she has heed some specific words, in regards to 'mending.' Merida is unsure just what this means, and the two sleep in the woods that evening, before having breakfast in the morning.\\n\\nMerida manages to catch some fish for her mother, but when her mother demands more, Merida tells her mother she will need to catch them herself. The mother and daughter bond over this method, but when her mother wanders off into the woods, Merida chases after her. However, upon finding her, her mother suddenly attempts to attack Merida, before returning to normal. With less than 24 hours, it seems that if they do not find a way to reverse the spell, Elinor will lose her humanity, and become a bear forever!\\n\\nAs they wander in the woods, the two come across the willo-the-wisps again, and follow them. They are lead to a high mountain, and the ruins of a great castle. Inside, Merida finds a stone tablet depicting 4 men, with one of them separated from the group. Soon, Merida realizes that she is in the castle in the legend her mother told her about, and soon makes the connection:\\n\\nThe brother who attempted to seize power from his siblings went to the witch, and her spell turned him into a bear...powerful and stronger than his brothers, but he was unable to change back, and became a rampaging beast, the same one who took Lord Fergus' leg!\\n\\nSuddenly, the bear emerges from the darkness and attempts to attack Merida. Elinor manages to save her daughter, and the two head back to the circle of stones. However, Merida is now sure what needs to be done. The witch's spell mentioned mending, and Merida feels that if she can mend the tapestry she cut the day before, her mother will be saved.\", '20,000 years ago, a grumpy mammoth named Manfred and a enthusiastic ground sloth named Sid are left behind during the migration for the ice age. Abandoned by his family, Sid attempts to migrate alone but runs afoul of his two rhinos best friends named Carl and Frank, who try to attack Sid but fail due to Manfred stepping in, only to leave Sid behind afterward. Sid stays with Manfred, referring to the mammoth as \"Manny\", for protection, much to Manny\\'s dismay.\\n\\nA tribe of humans camp near a waterfall, among them their leader, named Runar, with his wife Nadia and their infant son Roshan, before heading north to their settlement in the mountains. Soto, leader of a pack of saber-tooth tigers saber-tooth tiger, watches the humans with his trusted lieutenant, a cat named Diego. Soto, seeking revenge against the humans for wiping out half of his pack, intends to devour Runar\\'s son Roshan in vengeance and plans an attack for the next morning. The attack takes place, with Diego pursuing Nadia, but she escapes with Roshan, jumping over the waterfalls so that Diego returns to Soto with no baby; the pack agrees to meet at Half Peak, where Diego will produce the baby for Soto.\\n\\nManny and Sid journey on, Manny bothered by the sloth\\'s constant talking, until the two find Nadia on a riverbank, weakened greatly by her jump over the falls, with hardly enough strength to pass her son to Manny before she disappears. Manny leaves, but Sid intends to return the baby to his \"herd\", which Manny will not help with. The two meet Diego, who takes the baby, claiming that he intends to return him to the humans. Manny, unconvinced, decides to help Sid return the baby to his family, leaving the saber behind; the humans\\' camp is abandoned and Manny reluctantly decides to head north to find the humans\\' settlement at Glacier Pass and return the baby, taking Diego along as a guide. The trio takes the baby up north and meets a fanatical flock of dodos on the way, from which they procure food for the baby. During the trek, however, Diego secretly meets up with two of his pack mates, who pass a message from Soto, demanding the baby; Diego sends them back with a message to Soto, promising the baby and Manny. The following morning, Sid takes the baby to a mud crater, where he meets two female sloths named Jennifer and Rachel, who he tries to court using the baby, which Manny takes back; Sid returns to the mud crater, only to find the sloths gone, Carl and Frank in their place. The rhinos pursue Sid, who runs into Diego and pleads to the saber to deter the rhinos: Diego pretends to have killed Sid to throw the rhinos off the trail and releases his grip once the rhinos leave; Diego then moves on with Manny and Sid. On the way, the group runs into a number of predicaments, from a changing landscape to freezing ice age blizzards. The group meets a saber-tooth squirrel named Scrat, who had seen a pack of sabers go by and tries to tell Manny before Diego surreptitiously flicks Scrat away.\\n\\nFurther on, Diego spots the humans close by and suggests a shortcut to waylay Manny and Sid to an ambush point; this shortcut takes them through an ice cavern which leads to a cave adorned with paintings, all featuring animals. Among the paintings is the image of a mammoth family, hunted by humans, which Manny views, revealing that the mammoths depicted were Manny\\'s family and Manny himself: Manny\\'s wife and child were hunted by humans, leaving Manny alive and embittered at the world for his loss. The baby reaches out to the painting, comforting Manny in that he lets go of his bitterness at having lost his wife and child.\\n\\nFurther on, the group grows closer to Glacier Pass when they reach a lava field, which they must cross. Diego nearly falls into the lava but Manny saves him, falling into the lava pit himself as the ice he is standing on breaks off. Manny is launched out of the lava pit unharmed, launched out with the ice he stood on. Diego, in wonderment at Manny\\'s actions, asks why Manny risked his life to save him, Manny replying that such sacrifices where what herds did. Meanwhile, Soto and his pack plan for the ambush on Manny, aided by Diego.\\n\\nThat night, while settling down by campfire, Diego begins to see the error of his ways in betraying Manny. After the others fall asleep, Scrat appears on the scene with his acorn, planning to thaw it from the ice, baking it instead by mistake into a hot kernel. The group continued on, reaching Half Peak, where Diego, feeling remorse for betraying Manny\\'s trust, confesses his plans to Manny, which angers the mammoth. Manny pins Diego to a rock wall, intending to kill him for his misdeeds, but Diego, having had a change of heart, agrees to help Manny escape the pack.\\n\\nLeading the pack away from Manny, who they intended to ambush, Sid slides off on two pieces of bark with a decoy baby made of snow; the pack, however, catches up with Manny, who knocks them away with a log, trapping Soto\\'s assistant named Zeke, who Sid stomps into a hollow tree. Soto catches up with them and corners Manny, asking Diego to help bring the mammoth down; Diego defects from Soto and defends Manny at his own expense as Soto brings Diego down, wounding him. Soto then turns to Manny, intending to attack him alone, but the mammoth, in vengeance, knocks Soto into an ice wall, which jars loose a number of hanging icicles, impaling him. Sid and Manny abandon the Sabers. Soto and Zeke\\'s friends, Oscar and Lenny, mourn their killed leader as a result.\\n\\nManny, Sid and the baby are safe; Diego, however, is severely injured and appears to succumb to his wounds, leaving Manny and Sid to find the humans by themselves. The two find the humans, who ready themselves to attack when Manny produces Roshan, safe and sound. Grateful for Manny\\'s returning Roshan, Runar calls off the attack and bestows a beaded necklace to Manny in thanks before leaving with the baby. Manny and Sid leave and find Diego, who survived the attack due to his \"nine lives\". The three become a herd and decide to head south together, ending the movie.', 'As the credits appear, a pair of metallic hands with spindly fingers summons a doll from the dark abyss outside a window. The hands dismantle the doll, which is wearing a pink dress and has curly brown hair, and reassemble it into a new doll with blue hair, a yellow raincoat, and galoshes. Then they send it back into the void.\\n\\nCoraline Jones (voice: Dakota Fanning), a girl of 11 or so, moves with her parents, Mel and Charlie (voices: Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman), from their house in Michigan to their new home at the Pink Palace Apartments in Oregon. It is a rather dilapidated pink Victorian house divided into three flats, surrounded by forest and shaded by an almost constantly overcast sky. While her parents assist the movers, Coraline goes exploring, taking a stick and using it as a dowsing rod. She lets it guide her along a trail beyond the house until she arrives at the top of the hill. A black cat emerges from the woods and studies her on its perch. Coraline asks if it knows where the old well is before she is startled by an air horn. A bicyclist wearing a skull-painted helmet appears and circles Coraline. After she knocks him off his bike, he removes his helmet and introduces himself as Wybie -- short for Wyborne -- Lovat (voice: Robert Bailey Jr.), grandson of the owner of the Pink Palace. He shows Coraline the location of the old well, right under her feet, and admits surprise that his grandmother would allow a family with a kid to move in; not even he is allowed near the Pink Palace, though he says he\\'s not supposed to explain why. He pets the cat and explains that he cares for it despite the fact that it\\'s feral before he hears his grandmother calling to him. He mounts his bike and informs Coraline that the stick she\\'s holding is actually poison oak.\\n\\nBack at the house, as it starts to rain, Coraline attempts to gain the attention of her parents who are busy writing pieces for a gardening catalog (which Coraline finds absurdly ironic since her parents dislike handling dirt). Her mother gives Coraline a doll that looks just like her, telling her that it was left on their porch. Attached to the doll is a note from Wybie explaining that he found it in his grandmother\\'s trunk and thought she would like it since it looks like her. Coraline takes the doll and goes to see her father who tells her to explore the house and write down what she sees ... as long as she will let him work. Doll in hand, Coraline takes note of everything in their flat, including a painting of a sullen-looking boy in blue clothes above the fireplace. Finishing her notes, she discovers that her doll, which she\\'d left on a nearby table in the drawing room, has mysteriously moved beneath a mattress leaning against the wall. Coraline moves the mattress to find the outline of a small door behind the wallpaper. Noticing a keyhole and no other way to open it, Coraline begs her mother to help her. They find a black skeleton key in a kitchen drawer with a button end and find that it fits the keyhole perfectly. However, when they open the door, they see nothing but a solid brick wall. Irritated, Coraline\\'s mother tells her to let her finish her work.\\n\\nThat evening, Coraline is sent to bed early after complaining about the grimy-looking dinner her father prepared. In the middle of the night, she is awoken by a squeaking sound and looks down to see a mouse in her room. She follows it out of her room and downstairs to the drawing room where it disappears behind the small door in the wall which has been cracked open. Coraline opens the door and discovers that a wide and colorful passage has opened up. She crawls through it and emerges out the other end to find herself in the drawing room again, however, this one is brighter and even the painting of the boy above the fireplace looks cheerful. She smells something from the kitchen and wanders over to find her mother cooking. When her mother turns to greet her, Coraline sees that she has black buttons for eyes. Coraline\\'s shock subsides when her \\'mother\\' explains that she\\'s her Other Mother and that everyone has one. She tells Coraline to collect her Other Father in his study before dinner. Coraline obliges and finds her Other Father, looking lively and fun, playing piano with a pair of puppet hands protruding from it. He sings a song for Coraline, bringing a smile to her face, before they all sit down to dinner.\\n\\nThe Other World food is delightful and served with plenty of flair. Coraline can hardly contain her excitement at finding that her Other parents are more fun than her real ones, showing their enjoyment for mud and explaining that it\\'s a natural remedy for poison oak. When Other Mother offers to play a game, Coraline expresses concern that she\\'d better go back home and to bed. Other Mother takes Coraline up to her \\'other\\' room, which is strewn with colored streamers and toys that speak, including a picture on her nightstand with her two best friends from Michigan (voices: Harry Selick and Marina Budovsky). Her Other Mother rubs mud on the poison oak on her hands before putting Coraline to bed. Coraline quickly falls asleep. She wakes up the next morning to find herself back in her old room. She is disappointed but sees that the poison oak has disappeared from her hands. When she tries to open the small door again, she finds that it\\'s bricked up as before.\\n\\nShe tries to tell her parents all about her adventures the previous night, but they dismiss it as a vivid dream. Her mother suggests she tell her dream to the actresses living downstairs, although she calls them ding-bats. Out on the porch, Coraline trips over a pile of mail addressed to a Mr. Bobinsky; the man who lives upstairs. She goes to his door but is prevented entry by the eccentric Bobinsky (voice: Ian McShane), a tall and acrobatic Russian man with a blue complexion; possibly due to his role in the Chernobyl cleanup which is indicated by the medal worn on his shirt. He accepts the packages which contain foul-smelling cheese. He tells Coraline (whom he misnames \\'Caroline\\') that he is training circus mice and hopes the cheese will alleviate their apparent musical difficulties. Before Coraline leaves, he leaps down from his balcony to issue a warning from his mice: \"They say, \\'do not go through little door\\'.\"\\n\\nHalfway accepting her experiences as nothing but a dream, Coraline dismisses the message and heads to the lower flat to visit Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (voices: Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French), two retired burlesque actresses who clearly have not gotten over their past days. Coraline is offered tea as the actresses reminisce and tend to their many Scottie dogs, some of which are dead and stuffed on shelves on the wall, dressed in angel outfits. Miss Spink reads Coraline\\'s tea leaves and predicts that she is in danger, seeing a gnarled hand in the leaves, while Miss Forcible sees a giraffe from her perspective.\\n\\nCoraline goes outside, where a thick fog has covered the ground. She discovers Wybie spying on her with a three-turret lens, although he insists he\\'s hunting for banana slugs. The cat rests on Wybie\\'s shoulders as he skulks around, inspiring Coraline to call him a \\'wuss-puss\\' which insults the cat, though Wybie says he just doesn\\'t like getting his feet wet. The two share laughs as Coraline takes pictures of Wybie holding a slug before he admits that he\\'s never been inside the Pink Palace because his grandmother thinks it\\'s dangerous. He says that his grandmother had a twin sister and, while they lived there as children, she disappeared. His grandmother seems to think she was stolen, but Coraline offers that maybe she just ran away. She asks Wybie about the doll\\'s resemblance to her, but Wybie says that he found it as is and that it must be as old as the house. Coraline is skeptical: why would it look just like her?\\n\\nThat night, Coraline leaves out bits of cheese in her bedroom and goes to sleep, hoping for another visit from the mice. Sure enough, she\\'s woken later by their squeaking and follows them through the open portal. She finds her Other Mother cooking in the kitchen, using the very cheese Coraline laid out. She tells Coraline to fetch her Other Father, who is in the garden. Coraline finds him planting colorful, fluorescent flowers and snapdragons, using a tractor shaped like a praying mantis. Other Father takes Coraline for a ride on the mantis as it sprouts propellors and flies them above the gardens. Overhead, Coraline sees that the entire garden has been fashioned into her likeness. After another bountiful dinner, Other Mother opens the front door to introduce Other Wybie. She explains that she made this one so that he doesn\\'t talk because she thought Coraline would like it. Coraline is pleased with her silent friend and they go to Mr. Bobinsky\\'s flat together for a surprise. Inside, pedal-controlled cannons shoot cotton candy and popcorn machines line the walls. A circus tent is erected in the center of the apartment and Coraline and Other Wybie go in to see Bobinsky\\'s mice put on a musical show, bouncing on circus balls. At the finale, Other Bobinsky appears, looking dapper in a ringmaster\\'s coat and hat, and thanks them for their applause. Coraline is later led to bed, happily satisfied with the night\\'s events, and falls asleep with Other Mother, Other Father, and Other Wybie sitting beside her.\\n\\nThe next morning, Coraline grunts as she finds herself in her own bed once more. Her mother takes her into town the next day to shop for school clothes. They drop off her father at the train station so that he can deliver the latest edition of the catalog to the editor. At the store, Coraline approaches her mother with a pair of colorful gloves which Mel refuses to buy, looking instead at drab and grey uniform pieces. Coraline shuns her mother on the ride home, especially when Mel reveals that she locked the small door after finding rat excrement near it. Seeing that the fridge is nearly devoid of food, Mel offers to buy some groceries and asks Coraline to accompany her. Coraline refuses and Mel leaves, looking slightly saddened. Taking opportunity of her solitude, Coraline takes the skeleton key from its perch and investigates the small door, finding the passage surprisingly open. She eagerly crawls through as the feral cat watches her disapprovingly from outside. In Other World, Coraline finds the house seemingly empty, though the kitchen table is laden with treats and different foods along with a gift box containing a new outfit for her to wear. A note next to it from Other Mother explains that Other Spink and Other Forcible have something to show Coraline after lunch.\\n\\nOutside, Coraline comes upon the cat and remarks that he must be a copy but is missing the trademark button eyes. She is shocked when the cat speaks (voice: Keith David). He tells Coraline that he is the real world cat and has the ability to transverse the barriers between worlds, despite Other Mother\\'s attempts to keep him out; she hates cats. He admits it\\'s a type of game they play before warning Coraline of Other Mother\\'s true intentions. He claims Other Wybie told him of the dangers and, when Coraline doesn\\'t believe him, tells her that cats have superior senses. He then detects something in the distance and runs off. Coraline continues to Spink and Forcible\\'s apartment which has been turned into a large auditorium occupied by hundreds of Scottie dogs. She finds Other Wybie in the front row and sits beside him as the show starts. The Spink and Forcible that we know, albeit with painted button eyes, perform individual skits in rather unflattering outfits before their competition for the spotlight brings the stage props crashing down. The curtain closes and the second act starts; Spink and Forcible appear on either end of the stage, standing on diving boards while a bucket of water is pushed to center stage. Then, they literally jump out of their skins as their older facades unzip and their youthful, skinny selves effortlessly swing on trapeze wires. They include Coraline in the act, swinging her around the auditorium and catching her as they land on the bucket, to much applause and barking.\\n\\nCoraline returns to Other Mother\\'s apartment, raving about the show while Other Wybie stays behind looking sullen. As Other Mother ushers Coraline inside, she motions to Other Wybie to smile. She takes Coraline into the dining room and tells her that, if she wants to, she can stay forever but needs to perform one little thing. She places a box in front of Coraline who opens it to see two black buttons with sewing thread and a needle. Other Mother cheerfully tells Coraline that buttons are available in any color but Coraline vehemently refuses to sew buttons into her eyes. She requests to go to bed early to think things over and goes to her room where she stuffs her talking toys away and hides the picture of her button-eyed friends. She lies in bed and prays to go to sleep.\\n\\nWhen she wakes, she jumps out of bed, only to find that she\\'s still in Other World. She goes downstairs and finds Other Father morosely playing the piano with his puppet hands. Coraline demands to see Other Mother because she wants to go home, but Other Father tells her they mustn\\'t talk when \\'mother\\'s\\' not around. When Coraline says that she\\'s going to look for Other Wybie, Other Father tells her there\\'s no point; \"Wybie pulled a looooong face and \\'mother\\' didn\\'t like it,\" his own face elongating horribly as he says so before he is silenced by the puppet hands. Coraline runs outside and begins to walk away from the house. The cat approaches her and they walk together as the Other World begins to deteriorate into nothing. The cat tells Coraline that the Other Mother only created what she knew Coraline would like and soon they find themselves walking straight back towards the house. \"Small world,\" Coraline comments.\\n\\nThe cat reveals that the Other Mother wants her, possibly for something to love ... or to eat. Suddenly, he lunges into a bush and comes out with a circus mouse in his mouth. As his jaws clamp down, the mouse transforms into an ugly sandbag rat. \"I don\\'t like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm,\" the cat says before moving on. Coraline walks back into the house and enters the drawing room where the small door has been blocked by a beetle-shaped bureau. The other furniture comes to life, looking like insects, and seats Coraline in front of Other Mother, eating coco beetles. Coraline demands to be allowed to go home but Other Mother grows angry and tells Coraline to apologize as she counts to three. While she counts, her body begins to transform, growing grotesquely tall and elongated. (Eventually she is shown to be a spider.) At the count of three, the disfigured Other Mother grabs Coraline and throws her through a mirror into a dank room with a single bed. She tells Coraline she may come out when she \\'learns to be a loving daughter.\\'\\n\\nSensing someone in the room with her, Coraline turns to see three ghostly children, two girls and a boy (voices: Hannah Kaiser, Aankha Neal, and George Selick), who tell her to be quiet, for the Beldam might be listening. (Beldam means ugly old woman, but it has connotations of witchcraft and recalls characters from literature and folklore: the title character of John Keats\\'s poem \"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\", in which a knight is enthralled by a fairy; and the witch who entices and captures Hansel and Gretel.) The ghosts reveal that they don\\'t remember their names, but remember how the Beldam used dolls in their image to spy on them and see what made them unhappy. They tell how she lured them into Other World, giving them games and treats, telling them that she loved them. Wanting more, the children allowed the Beldam to sew the buttons into their eyes, but she ate up their lives and cast their souls aside, locking them inside the mirror. They say that their eyes were stolen and hidden and ask that, if Coraline escapes, she set their souls free by finding their eyes. Coraline says that she\\'ll try before she\\'s pulled through the mirror by Other Wybie, whose mouth has been sewn into a wide grin. Coraline pulls the thread out before Other Wybie brings her to the small door. He opens it and shoves her through. When she asks him to come with her, he pulls off one of his gloves, revealing that he\\'s nothing inside but sand. He then shuts the door as the Beldam calls for Coraline. She crawls back to the real world and calls out for her real parents.\\n\\nHowever, she finds no one home. The groceries that her mother had gone out to get lie on the kitchen table, moldy and covered in flies. When a knock sounds at the door, Coraline eagerly opens it only to see the real Wybie, who tells her that he needs the doll back. His grandmother is angry because the doll once belonged to her missing sister, but Coraline tells him that the doll once looked like the three ghost children. She realizes that the third child, the girl with the braids and ribbons, was Grandma Lovat\\'s missing sister. She brings Wybie upstairs to give him the doll, explaining everything along the way. Coraline describes to an incredulous Wybie how the doll is meant to spy on everything that\\'s wrong with a child\\'s life before the Other Mother gives false promises to trap them. When she can\\'t find the doll, Wybie runs from the house screaming that Coraline is crazy. She throws her shoes at him and runs outside to see her parents\\' car, but no one is there. A phone call to her father brings no answers either.\\n\\nCoraline visits Spink and Forcible as Spink is sewing an angel outfit on her dog Angus, claiming that he hasn\\'t been feeling well lately. When Coraline worries about her missing parents, Spink and Forcible break a ball of hard taffy candy to reveal a small triangular seeing stone with a hole in it. They give it to Coraline, saying that it\\'s useful for bad or lost things (they can\\'t agree on which one specifically). Coraline then returns home and creates likenesses of her parents out of pillows in their bed before crying herself to sleep. She wakes up in the middle of the night to see the cat sitting on her chest, looking at her closely. She asks him if he knows where her parents are. He pulls Coraline\\'s doll out from under the bed but, instead of looking like her, the doll is two-faced, resembling each of her parents. In the hallway mirror, Coraline sees an image of her parents shivering in the cold and writing \\'help us\\' on the frosted glass. She goes downstairs and lights a fire on the hearth, throwing the doll into the flames to curl up and burn. Knowing her parents can\\'t return on their own, she resolves to rescue them and dons her favorite army hat, a vest, and puts the triangle stone, some tools, and the skeleton key in her pockets.\\n\\nAs she and the cat go through the small door, the cat pipes up and tells her to challenge the Other Mother to a game; she never refuses games. Though the Beldam won\\'t play fair, this gives Coraline the best chance. When Coraline emerges, she hears her mother calling to her and finds her in the drawing room. She goes to hug her mother, but the figure transforms into the Beldam. She takes the skeleton key from Coraline and, after locking the small door, swallows it. Other Father, reduced to a squat, blubbering mess, puts Coraline into a chair before he is dragged away by the furniture after the Beldam inquires about tending to the garden. The Beldam then takes Coraline into the kitchen to serve her breakfast, asking her again to stay. Coraline proposes a game: if she is able to find her real parents and the eyes of the ghost children, the Beldam must let them all go. If Coraline is unsuccessful, she will stay and let the Beldam sew the buttons into her eyes. Coraline then demands a clue, which the Beldam relents to give: \"In each of three wonders I\\'ve made just for you, a ghost\\'s eye is lost in plain sight.\"\\n\\nCoraline\\'s search begins in the garden, where some hummingbird plants attempt to steal the triangular stone. Finding this curious, Coraline looks through the hole in the stone to see that the world appears grey, except for one colorful ball of light: the first eye. It is disguised as the shift knob on the praying mantis tractor. Other Father starts the tractor and chases Coraline with it. He apologizes, claiming that \\'mother\\' is making him do it. As the mantis chases Coraline across the garden pond\\'s bridge, it collapses, sending the tractor and Other Father into the water. Before he submerges, Other Father grabs the eye and hands it over to Coraline. With the eye in hand, the entire garden dies and turns to stone.\\n\\nMeanwhile the moon overhead is beginning to eclipse -- a time limit on Coraline\\'s search. She makes her way to Spink and Forcible\\'s place, which has deteriorated. The Scottie dogs now reside on the ceiling, looking more like bats, and the actresses have cocooned themselves in a taffy-like wrapper on the stage. Coraline sees one of them holding the second eye as a pearl ring and reaches into the wrapper to get it. However, she wakes the actresses, their tangled bodies resembling taffy, and they shriek and grab at her. Coraline shines her flashlight at the dogbats overhead, agitating them and inciting them to fly down at her. She ducks in time for the dogs to collide with the actresses and Coraline gains control of the eye. The auditorium turns to grey stone and Spink and Forcible disintegrate with the dogs.\\n\\nNext, Coraline goes to Other Bobinsky\\'s apartment where she sees, dangling from a pole on the balcony, the empty clothes of Other Wybie. She shouts to the Beldam that she\\'s not scared before entering the apartment. Bobinsky emerges from the shadows, reduced to only his ringmaster coat and hat, asking why Coraline would want to leave a perfect world. She answers that he couldn\\'t understand since he\\'s merely a copy of the real Bobinsky. Using the stone, she finds the third eye inside Other Bobinsky\\'s hat. She removes his hat to retrieve it but his clothes fall away to reveal the circus rats within. The head rat shrieks at her and attempts to flee with the eye in its mouth. The others try to sabotage Coraline and, as a last resort, she throws the triangular seeing stone at the head rat as it exits the doggy door of Bobinsky\\'s apartment. She misses. She chases the rat onto the balcony which begins to fall apart and collapses. Coraline falls to the ground below and begins to cry when she realizes that she\\'s lost the rat, and the game. The eclipse of the moon completes, revealing the shadow to be that of a button.\\n\\nThe cat then appears with the rat in its mouth and relinquishes the last eye. Coraline thanks him and then, together, they go back inside to find her real parents, the paint on the walls thinning and peeling off. She meets the Beldam in the drawing room, darker and filled with webbing. The Beldam herself has been reduced to her true form; a large, spidery figure with spindly fingers and cracked, white skin. She sneers at the cat and holds up the triangular stone before throwing it into the fire. Without her tool, Coraline is forced to use her wit to guess the location of her parents. She announces that her parents are behind the small door in the wall. The Beldam coughs up the key and as she goes to open the door, Coraline sees her parents miniaturized and trapped within a snowglobe on the mantle. With the door open, the Beldam turns to Coraline, chuckling and saying that she\\'s now trapped in Other World forever. \"No I\\'m not!\" Coraline shouts, throwing the cat at the Beldam, grabbing the snowglobe and stuffing it in her pocket. The cat scratches out the Beldam\\'s button eyes and the room falls apart, leaving nothing but a low net of webbing. The cat howls and runs through the small door as Coraline struggles to avoid falling into the center of the net. As she climbs, the vibrations are felt by the sightless Beldam who climbs after her. Coraline manages to get through the small door just in time as the Beldam shrieks and wails that she will die without her. Coraline slams the small door shut in the real world and locks it.\\n\\nCoraline\\'s parents \\'come home\\' and she runs over to embrace them, though they scold her for breaking the snowglobe and cutting her knee. Despite the snow melting off their shoulders, they have no recollection of what happened and announce that they\\'re going out to eat that night in celebration of the published catalog. After discussing invitations for a garden party, Coraline\\'s parents put her to bed. Her mother leaves a box on her bed; it contains the pair of colorful gloves she\\'d wanted. Coraline goes to sleep, happy to be home at last.\\n\\nShe wakes in the middle of the night to see the cat outside her window. Though he is visibly upset with her, she apologizes for throwing him at the Beldam and he snuggles up beside her in bed as she places the three ghost children\\'s eyes under her pillow. She dreams that they are finally free spirits and they thank her but warn her that the Beldam lives and will never stop looking for her. Coraline awakes to find that the eyes are broken beneath her pillow but realizes that the skeleton key is what the Beldam is after and she must hide it. She dresses and leaves, resolving to dump the key inside the well at the top of the hill. However, the Beldam\\'s spindly hand, having escaped through the door, follows her. When it discovers her intent, it attacks her and attempts to take the key back. Coraline struggles with it until Wybie appears to help, riding his bike and blowing his air horn. He grabs at the key but the hand trips him up and he falls into the well, dangling as he holds onto some roots. Before the hand can stab at him, Coraline wraps it in her shawl which it quickly rips through. Before it can pounce again, Wybie, having gotten himself out of the well, drops a large rock on it, breaking it. He and Coraline wrap the hand and rock together in the shawl and tie it with the key string before dropping it into the well.\\n\\nWybie apologizes for not believing Coraline and shows her a picture of his grandmother as a child...with her twin sister holding an identical doll. He then hears his grandmother calling for him again and Coraline tells him to bring her to the garden party the next day where they will tell her everything together. At the party, everyone gathers to help plant flowers in the garden and Coraline distributes cold drinks. Wybie escorts his grandmother to the party and Coraline offers her a drink, saying that she has so much to tell her.\\n\\nJust beyond the house, the cat sits on the sign post in front of the Pink Palace. He stretches and walks along the beam, passing the tip of the post and vanishing from sight.', 'Agent Rick Dicker (Jonathan Banks) is interviewing a boy named Tony Rydinger. Tony tells him how he met up with a classmate named Violet Parr (Sarah Vowell) at a track meet, and they agreed to go on a date together. Later, in the parking lot, a supervillain who called himself the Underminer (John Ratzenberger) burrowed up through the ground and said he was declaring war on peace and happiness. Everyone else scattered, but Tony found himself with no easy escape route, so he ducked behind a car and watched what unfolded. He saw a family of superheroes in matching suits, and the mother told one of the kids to patrol the perimeter and keep people away, and the other one to watch the baby, Jack-Jack. As the parents went after the Underminer, Tony saw an opportunity to escape, but then he recognized the voice of the girl. The boy ran off with super speed to do perimeter duty, leaving her alone with the baby. Frustrated, she ripped off her mask and threw it on the ground. Then Tony saw that she was Violet. Seeing him looking at her, she walked up to him and tried to explain, but he just ran away. He tells Rick that he feels bad about what he did, and he wishes he could just forget ever seeing Violet in her super suit.\\n\\nThe Underminer bored back into the ground, setting off an underground explosion that caused bank buildings to collapse into the ground. Drilling through the vaults, he used a tube with vacuum suction to grab cash from the vaults. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) confronts him, and the Underminer turns toward him, sucking him into the tube. He landed in the tunneler\\'s storage vault and banged his way out with super strength. The Underminer puts the borer on autopilot, and the two of them fought. Mr. Incredible pushed the Underminer into the borer\\'s control panel, smashing it. The Underminer jumped into the vault and escaped, leaving Mr. Incredible to deal with the now out-of-control drill. It burst through the surface into the street. Dash (Huck Milner) saw a dust cloud in the distance and ran toward it, with Violet pushing Jack-Jack in his stroller and running after Dash. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) stretched herself from one building to another, catching up to the careening drill. It slammed into a support column, destroying the monorail track right as a vehicle approached. Suddenly, their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) glided in and made a track that guided the monorail safely to the ground. The borer was still running down the street, scraping the sides of buildings along the way. The drill hit a car and flung it into the air, and Dash ran up to an old woman and pulled her out of the way just before the car crashed down. Violet caught up to him and handed off Jack-Jack in the stroller. Elastigirl stretched herself out across an overpass, stopping cars from getting on a bridge as the drill destroyed the supports. Mr. Incredible grabbed a fallen streetlamp and threw it into the treads, but it soon snapped. Dash ran up to him and put Jack-Jack in his hands. Violet threw up force fields to protect bystanders from the machine. Mr. Incredible ran past her and handed Jack-Jack back to her. Elastigirl jumped into the open hatch of the borer, with the rest of the family chasing after it. They saw that it was heading straight for City Hall. Elastigirl stretched out through the engine, trying to spill the coolant so it would overheat. Mr. Incredible jumped in and helped her, and they stopped the drill just short of City Hall. Violet and Dash jumped in, and she put a force field around the whole family just before the engine blew. Looking out the hatch, they saw themselves surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.\\n\\nRick Dicker gives the family a ride, and Violet tells them that Tony had seen her without her mask. Rick brings them to the hotel room where they\\'ve been staying since their house had been destroyed. Rick tells them that the Super Relocation Program has been shut down, and he can only let them stay in the hotel for two more weeks, after which they\\'ll be on their own. They say goodbye to him, and sit down at the table to eat Chinese takeout. Violet asks them if they\\'re going to talk about the day\\'s events. Helen tells them that things are different now, with supers being forbidden to do hero work. Violet asks if that means they\\'re going to go back to never using their powers. After going back and forth, Helen slams her hand down on the table, ending the conversation. Later that night, after the kids fell asleep, Bob and Helen are sitting at the hotel pool, wondering what they\\'re going to do. Helen tells him that one of them will have to get a regular job. Suddenly, Lucius shows up, and he offers to let the family move in with himself and his wife, Honey (Kimberly Adair Clark) after their time in the hotel is up. Then he tells them that during the Underminer attack, a man who represents the business tycoon Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) handed him a business card, and said that Winston wanted to talk to Lucius, Bob and Helen. With no other options, they agree to the meeting.\\n\\nThe three of them show up outside a huge building, the headquarters of DevTech. They get security badges and take the elevator to the top floor, and are greeted by Winston. A woman also walks up and Winston introduces her as his sister, Evelyn (Catherine Keener). He tells them he saw what they did with their kids earlier, and they shoot each other a look, realizing he knows their secret identities. He says he used to work for Rick years ago, before the Supers were forced into hiding, and he explains that Rick was a huge fan of them. Rick had a direct phone line installed in the Deavor house, so they could call the Supers any time they needed them. Winston tells them that one night thieves broke into their house, and his father tried to call Gazerbeam and Fironic, but since Supers had been outlawed, neither one of them answered. The thieves found his dad and shot him. A few months later, Winston\\'s mom died from heartbreak. He says that if the Supers hadn\\'t been in hiding, it never would have happened. Evelyn counters that her dad should\\'ve hidden himself at the first sign of trouble, and Winston explains that they\\'ve had that argument forever. Since then, Winston and Evelyn built DevTech, a telecommunications company, with the goal of righting some wrongs. Winston and Evelyn explain that the Supers have been in hiding because of the people\\'s perception. All they see is the destruction the Supers cause, not the hard decisions they make or the lives they save. To change that, Evelyn shows them that there are cameras in their badges, and says their new super suits will have cameras as well. Winston says they just need to be super, and he\\'ll make sure they\\'ll all be legal again some day. Enthusiastically, Bob asks what their first assignment will be, but Winston says that Elastigirl should be the first Super that the public sees in action. Bob reluctantly agrees, but Helen is still unsure.\\n\\nBack at the hotel, Bob asks Helen why she wouldn\\'t want to take the opportunity, and she explains that the children will need her. Dash is struggling with math, and Violet is nervous about her upcoming date with Tony. Jack-Jack, being a baby, will naturally need lots of attention, whether he has powers or not. Neither of them knew that he had used his powers once before, to escape from being kidnapped by Syndrome, since at the time they were on the ground and he was high in the air, beyond their sight. Bob tells her that the choice is to change the world to allow their children to be who they are, or to possibly soon be homeless. She asks if he\\'ll be okay watching the kids, and he says he can handle it with no problem. Lying down to sleep, they knew tomorrow they\\'d tell Winston that Elastigirl was in.\\n\\nWinston sends a limo to pick up the family and take them to a huge house that he owns, and he says they can stay as long as they need. Later, Elastigirl comes out of the bathroom wearing her new super suit, one that was designed by Alexander Galbaki. Bob teases her that when Edna Mode (Brad Bird) finds out, she won\\'t be happy. Helen finds a note from Evelyn saying there\\'s something in the garage for her. She goes out and finds a motorcycle that can split into two parts. Bob watches as she takes off down the street. The next morning, Bob fixes breakfast for the kids, and Violet asks him if Helen is breaking the law by doing hero work. Bob is relieved to see the school bus pull up, and sends the kids off.\\n\\nThat night, Violet gets ready for her date with Tony. Bob reads Jack-Jack a bedtime story, and the baby falls asleep. Bob then tries to help Dash with his math homework, but Dash tells him they want the problems done a certain way, and then says he\\'ll just wait until Helen comes home. The TV turns on, and Bob is surprised to see Jack-Jack sitting on the couch. He takes him back up to his room and reads another story.\\n\\nIn the city, Elastigirl is in attendance at the unveiling ceremony of a new hovertrain. The mayor gives a speech as the Deavors watch in a studio through Helen\\'s bodycam. The mayor cut the ribbon, and the train got its first group of passengers. It lifts up and suddenly takes off in the wrong direction. Elastigirl jumps on her cycle and takes off after it. Riding through tunnels and on rooftops, she is able to land on top of the train. Before she can plan her next move, the train goes into a tunnel. She ditches the bike and flattens herself on the roof. She reaches the engineer and finds him staring straight ahead. Coming out of the tunnel, Elastigirl makes herself into a parachute and slows the train to a stop. Going back to the engineer, she notices a pulsing light in his cabin. A message appears on a monitor saying \"Welcome back, Elastigirl--The Screenslaver\"\\n\\nBob keeps trying to get Jack-Jack to stay in his bed, with no luck. Going downstairs, he finds Violet, who never left for her date, and she tells him not to say anything. Bob goes back to the living room and sits Jack-Jack down next to him and falls asleep. On the TV, a movie is playing with a masked robber holding a man at gunpoint. Jack-Jack sees the masked man, and then looks out the window and sees a raccoon rummaging through the trash. He walks up to the window and is able to pass through it with his powers. Grabbing a half-eaten chicken leg away from the raccoon, he throws it back in the garbage can and uses another power to lift the lid with his mind and slam it down on the can. Then laser beams come out of his eyes, just missing the raccoon. Bob wakes up from the commotion and goes outside to grab Jack-Jack. Just then, the baby split into six separate copies of himself. Bob realizes that Jack-Jack has multiple superpowers. Taking Jack-Jack back inside, Bob gets a call from Helen. She asks him how things are going, and he lies and says the kids are just fine. She tells him about saving the runaway train, and he turns on the TV to see news reports about the dramatic rescue. She thanks him for taking care of the kids, and they hang up. Bob puts Dash and Jack-Jack to bed, and then cracks open Dash\\'s math book. Later, he wakes up Dash and tells him that he understands the math problems and can help Dash before school starts.\\n\\nElastigirl is getting ready to be interviewed by a news anchor named Chad Brentley. Chad is interviewing a foreign ambassador as Helen sits in a green room, nervously waiting for her turn. A stage hand comes in and walks her toward the stage. The ambassador sees Helen and greets her enthusiastically. Chad introduces Elastigirl to the audience, and she walks out to the stage. Suddenly, Chad\\'s eyes glaze over and he starts talking in a robotic monotone. Following his eyes, Helen notices a blinking light on a screen. She looks away just in time to avoid being hypnotized herself. Chad says that everyone is being controlled by screens. Helen makes her way to the control room, where she finds everyone staring ahead blankly. The robotic voice continues, saying that the screens are being controlled by the Screenslaver. The voice says the Screenslaver will hijack the ambassador\\'s aerocade, and Helen runs and smashes a window. Stretching herself out of the building, she climbs on a rooftop and sees three helicopters airborne. Launching herself like a slingshot, she crashes through one of the helicopters\\' windows, but the ambassador isn\\'t there. She tells the pilot to get her close to another copter, and she makes the jump. Finding the ambassador in the back, she breaks open the door to the cockpit and sees the pilots in a trance. She smashes the screen with the blinking light to bring them back. Just then, the third chopper smashes into them. Struggling to gain control, she asks the pilots if they can swim, then pushes them out so they land in the river below. Then she grabs the ambassador and slings herself into the air, making a parachute to bring the ambassador safely to the ground.\\n\\nThe next morning, Bob is getting the kids ready for school. Violet looks awful and tells him that yesterday at school, she asked Tony why he stood her up, and he acted like he didn\\'t know her at all. Bob tells her that Rick has had to erase many people\\'s memories after they found out his or Helen\\'s secret identity. Violet realizes that Rick had erased Tony\\'s memory, after Bob told him to. Stomping off, she grabs her super suit and stuffs it in the garbage disposal and turns it on. But since the suit is indestructible, nothing happens to it. Angrily, she grabs it and throws it against the wall, vowing never to be a hero again.\\n\\nHelen is in a limousine, being given a ride back to the DevTech building. There, a group of people cheer for her, making her feel proud, but she knows the Screenslaver is still out there. Inside, Winston hands her a newspaper that has a headline about the ambassador giving a pro-Super speech, and he tells her their plan is working. She tries to be enthusiastic, but she\\'s still worried about the Screenslaver. He leads her into a room filled with other superheroes in costume. One of the women introduces herself as Voyd (Sophia Bush), and demonstrates her power to make portals that can instantly transport people or things anywhere. Other supers come up and introduce themselves as Screech, Brick, Reflux and He-lectric. They all chatted a while, and Helen is proud of the positive effect she\\'s had on them. Talking with Evelyn, Helen hits upon a plan to lure the Screenslaver out. Evelyn will make a tracking device, and while Chad interviews Helen remotely, they\\'ll track the signal.\\n\\nBob calls Rick and asks him if he remembers wiping Tony\\'s memory, then explains that he went too far, erasing all memory of Violet from his mind. Rick replies that memory wiping isn\\'t an exact science. Bob asks Rick for any information he has about Tony, and Rick tells him that Tony\\'s parents own a restaurant where he works after school. That night, Bob takes the kids out to dinner. Violet wonders why he\\'s taking them across town to one specific restaurant. Sitting down at the table, they\\'re greeted by their waiter, Tony. Startled, Violet shoots water out of her nose, and Tony offers her napkins to clean herself up. Bob tries to push Violet into chatting with Tony, but she just gets more embarrassed and angry. She pushes herself away from the table and walks out of the restaurant.\\n\\nAt the station, Chad is talking with Helen through a monitor, and she tells him that she\\'s at a secure, undisclosed location. She\\'s actually on top of the building, on a transmission tower. Chad shows footage from the hovertrain rescue, when the Screenslaver appears on the monitors. Activating her tracker, Helen locates the source of the signal. The Screenslaver rants about how people are controlled by screens because they\\'re lazy. Meanwhile, Elastigirl vaults from one building to another, zeroing in on the source. Finally, she arrives at an apartment building. Snaking her arm under the door, she unlocks it and runs in. The Screenslaver appears behind her and pushes her and himself into a giant cage, then zaps her with a taser. He turns on blinking lights to hypnotize her, but she manages to push him out of the cage and slither out herself. They fight around the room, then he runs out the door, activating a timer on the way out. She runs after him, and he activates a fire alarm, causing others to come running out. He slips down an elevator shaft and onto a rooftop, with Helen in pursuit. Suddenly, he leaps off the roof. Helen jumps after him, grabs him and makes a parachute. As the timer hits zero, the building blows up, and she reaches up and grabs the mask off his face. On the ground, he\\'s led away in handcuffs by the police, acting confused. Helen thanks Evelyn for setting up the tracker.\\n\\nBack at the house, Dash asks Bob for help with his new math lesson. Watching TV, Bob sees a story about how a car called the Incredible, a car he once owned when he was a public superhero, had been bought by a billionaire at an auction. Thinking the car had been destroyed along with his house, Bob angrily rummages through some boxes and finds the old remote control for the car. Pressing a button, he makes the car start on the screen. Dash snatches the remote and starts pressing buttons. Everyone in the studio takes cover from the seemingly live car. Bob grabs the remote back and powers it down. Suddenly Jack-Jack sneezes and teleports himself into Violet\\'s room. She runs down the stairs screaming, as Jack-Jack now has turned into a red monster, chasing after her. Jack-Jack turns back into his normal self, and Dash and Violet realize he has powers, and Bob hadn\\'t told them. Violet asks if he told Helen, and he says no. When she asks why, he angrily tells them that he\\'s Mr. Incredible, and he\\'s trying to hold the house together through everything. Taken aback, Violet says that she\\'s going to call Lucius.\\n\\nLucius comes over, and he sees Jack-Jack suddenly turn invisible. Weary, Bob grabs cookies and holds one up to lure Jack-Jack out. He reappears, grabs the cookie and munches on it. Bob tells Lucius that he can\\'t keep giving Jack-Jack cookies, but when he stops, the red monster appears and starts biting Bob\\'s arm. Desperate for some relief, Bob takes Jack-Jack and drives up to Edna\\'s house. Seeing him looking like he hadn\\'t slept in days, she invites him in. He tells her that he needs some alone time, and asks if he can leave Jack-Jack with her. Jack-Jack looks at her face and transforms his own nose to look like hers. Bit by bit, he transforms the rest of his face to match her. Fascinated by his powers, she agrees to take him and quickly shoves Bob out the door. Bob goes back to the house and collapses on the sofa. He apologizes to Violet for having Rick erase Tony\\'s memory, then making things worse at the restaurant. He says he\\'s just trying to be a good dad, and Violet replies that he\\'s not good, he\\'s super. She hugs him, before realizing that he fell asleep sitting up.\\n\\nAt the Deavors\\' house, a party was going with video playing of Elastigirl catching the Screenslaver. Winston announces that Supers will be legal again, and he triumphantly holds up the Screenslaver\\'s suit and goggles, saying that Elastigirl is the one who made it all possible. He says they\\'ll sign an agreement on his ship, the Everjust, and it will be televised around the world. Helen rewatches the footage of the Screenslaver capture, and she realizes that something isn\\'t quite right. She slips away to the control room and watches some of the raw footage. Evelyn comes in behind her with drinks, happy to be away from the crowd. She tells Helen that her brother knows how to handle people, but she herself never knows what they want. Helen asks her what she thinks they want, and she replies that people value ease more than anything. Helen tells her that she thinks catching the Screenslaver was too easy, then she notices that one of the Screenslaver\\'s monitors is tuned into her suit camera. Evelyn says that he must have hacked into the closed circuit, but Helen replies that if he was able to do that, he wouldn\\'t just have simple locks on his door. She realizes that he himself must have been hypnotized by the goggles he was wearing, and she grabs the goggles to inspect them. With a swift move, Evelyn forces the goggles onto Helen\\'s head.\\n\\nBob wakes up groggy, and realizes he had been sleeping on the couch. Violet took off his shoes and gave him a blanket and pillow. Later, he goes to Edna\\'s house and thanks her for watching Jack-Jack. She says that she stayed up all night, working on a suit that will control all of his powers. Putting Jack-Jack into the testing chamber, she shows Bob how Jack-Jack\\'s suit can anticipate which of his powers he\\'s about to use. When Jack-Jack turns into a flame, the suit activates an extinguisher with blackberry-flavored fire retardant spraying all over him, and he happily licks it up. Relieved at finally having some control, Bob takes Jack-Jack and puts him in the car.\\n\\nAs the blinking lights in the goggles go out, Helen wakes from her trance, finding herself strapped to a chair. Trying to move, she lets out a scream of pain. Evelyn comes on the intercom and tells her that the temperature around her is below freezing, and that if she tries to stretch, she\\'ll break. Helen realizes that Evelyn is the real Screenslaver, and the person she locked away was an innocent victim. Helen tells Evelyn that she counted on her, and Evelyn asks her why, because she built her a bike? Evelyn says that they didn\\'t really know each other. Helen asks about her brother, and Evelyn replies that he\\'s weak, depending on the Supers to always save him, just like his father did. Helen asks if she\\'s going to kill her, and Evelyn says that she plans to use her instead.\\n\\nBack at the house, the kids see Jack-Jack in his new suit. Bob demonstrates how he can now control the baby, with Jack-Jack using his laser eyes on command. Then Jack-Jack uses his warp power to disappear, and Bob shows them a device to scan for his location. Seeing him in the corner, Dash holds out a cookie, which Jack-Jack reappears to grab and chomp down. The phone rings, and Evelyn tells Bob that Helen is in trouble. She says she doesn\\'t want to say what happened on the phone, and it\\'s best if he meets her at DevTech, where the ship is docked. Bob immediately calls Lucius and tells him to watch the kids, and to bring his super suit, since things might get weird. Suspicious at Bob\\'s sudden leaving, Dash runs and grabs the car\\'s remote control, and Violet gets out the super suits and has them all put the suits on. The doorbell rings, and they open it to see the other supers from the party, all being controlled with a pair of goggles.\\n\\nVoyd tells them that they\\'re not safe, and the Deavors sent them for protection. Just then, Frozone runs up and stands between them and the kids, telling them they\\'re not needed. He tries to shut the door, but they block him. Dash presses a button on the remote, activating the Incredible, which blasts out of its garage and flies toward the house. Frozone blasts the Supers with an ice wall and slams the door. Dash grabs Jack-Jack as the Supers force their way in. Dash tries to run outside, but he keeps finding himself still inside the house, thanks to Voyd\\'s portals. As Frozone is fighting Screech, Violet creates a force field around herself and her brothers to shield them from He-lectrix\\'s zapping blasts. As Krushauer tries to crush the force field, the Incredible flies in and stops just before them. Dash and Violet get in and escape, but the other Supers grab Frozone and put a pair of goggles on his head.\\n\\nEvelyn takes Bob to see Helen on the ship, and as soon as he walks in, Helen starts punching him in the face. Stunned at first, Bob tries to fight back, but he can\\'t bring himself to attack his wife. As she comes at him with more punches and kicks, he grabs her and tries to break her trance. She kisses him, and with surprise, he kisses back. Then she stretches and grabs a pair of goggles from Evelyn and puts them on his head.\\n\\nEvelyn tells Winston that the heroes are on the ship, resting, and he orders the ship to head out. In the Incredible, Dash and Violet take a moment to decide what to do. They realize they have only themselves, the car and Jack-Jack. They get to the DevTech building and see the ship take off. Dash wishes the car could follow the ship, and it drives itself off the dock and into the water. Jetting itself along, the car quickly catches up to the ship. Violet asks how they\\'ll get on the ship, and Dash replies that it would be great if the car had ejector seats. A message flashes across the dashboard, \"Ejector seats activated.\" Suddenly they find themselves flying through the air toward the ship. Violet surrounds them with a force field, allowing them to land safely on deck. Just then, Winston activates the ship\\'s hydrofoil, causing it to float out of the water. Evelyn has Winston gather the supers in a room for the signing ceremony. Violet sees them go into the room, then comes back to Dash to find that Jack-Jack had gone missing. Using the tracker, they find him going up in an elevator. They go to follow, but are cut off by Voyd, who attacks Violet. She tries to fight back by using force fields, but Voyd keeps opening portals to deflect them. Dash takes off after Jack-Jack, but he realizes Violet isn\\'t behind him, so he runs back and speed-punches Voyd before she can put goggles on Violet.\\n\\nThe kids find Jack-Jack in a hall and grab him. With the other Supers coming behind, they hide in a vent. Trying to keep Jack-Jack quiet, they give him the tracker to play with. Hearing Jack-Jack coo, Krushauer uses his power to crush the vent. Getting angry, Jack-Jack transforms into a giant baby and bursts out of the vent, knocking out Krushauer and destroying the tracker. Violet uses a cookie to calm Jack-Jack, who grabs it and goes smashing through the walls, heading toward the room where the Supers are gathered. Turning back to his normal size, he teleports through the last wall. Dash and Violet look for another way in. As the signing ceremony goes live, Evelyn takes control of all of the Supers, having them tell the world that they don\\'t serve the people anymore, only themselves. They reach toward the camera, and the feed goes dead.\\n\\nBack at the studio, Chad awkwardly tells the audience to stand by as they sort out their technical issues. On the ship, Evelyn watches as Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and Frozone lock the delegates in the room with the other Supers. They head up to the bridge and quickly disarm a guard, who gets on his radio and exclaims that Supers have taken the ship. Elastigirl turns the steering wheel, guiding the ship on a path toward the city. Mr. Incredible crushes the wheel, rendering the ship unsteerable. Dash and Violet follow Jack-Jack to the bridge, and without hesitation, their parents and Frozone attack them. Violet throws up a force field for protection, and Jack-Jack floats through the air, landing in Elastigirl\\'s arms. With her momentarily confused, Jack-Jack reaches up and rips off her goggles. Evelyn orders Mr. Incredible and Frozone to grab her, but she rips off their goggles.\\n\\nThe other Supers burst in and attack, and Jack-Jack transforms into a monster. Elastigirl is surprised to see that he has powers. He-lectrix tries to attack Violet, but monster Jack-Jack rips off his goggles. Soon, all the goggles are off and the Supers stop fighting, but the ship is still heading for the city. Evelyn grabs Winston and heads for a jet. Bob tells Helen to go after her, to finish the mission, while they handle the ship. Bob goes for the engine compartment, but is confronted by Krushauer, still wearing a pair of goggles. He tries to crush Bob with the walls, but he quickly jumps out of the way and hurls a piece of debris at Krushauer, knocking off his goggles. Krushauer is free from his trance, but now the room is filled with debris, blocking his entrance to the engine room. Winston is coming out of his camera-induced trance, and he realizes his sister is the Screenslaver. She pulls him into the jet, but he jumps out before she takes off. Running back to the room, he turns off the screen that was keeping everyone hypnotized, and orders them all to the back of the ship. Elastigirl and Voyd go to the deck and see Evelyn taking off. Voyd opens a portal for Elastigirl to use, and she lands on top of the jet. She forces her way in, and Evelyn starts flying wildly, flinging Elastigirl all around the cabin. Elastigirl makes her way to the pilot\\'s chair and is about to punch Evelyn, but she puts an oxygen mask on herself and starts climbing rapidly. With the air getting thinner, Elastigirl starts to feel weak.\\n\\nOn the ship, Mr. Incredible tells the others that he can\\'t stop the ship, and Dash suggests turning it from the outside. Frozone freezes one of the foils, causing it to break and sending the ship back down to the water. Mr. Incredible lowers the anchor, wrapping himself in the chain. He gets plunged into the water, with Dash waiting for him to turn the rudder. As time passes, Dash gets increasingly worried. But then, the ship starts to turn, and Dash presses the button to lift the anchor.\\n\\nOn the jet, Evelyn kicks Elastigirl in the face. Spotting a flare gun, Elastigirl fires it at Evelyn\\'s oxygen tank, creating an explosion that sends Evelyn flying out the window. Elastigirl puts the jet on autopilot, swings out the window, grabs Evelyn and makes a parachute. Refusing to be saved by a Super, Evelyn kicks herself free and starts falling again, but Elastigirl grabs her again and Voyd opens a portal over the water, depositing them both safely on the ship\\'s deck.\\n\\nWith the ship turning away from the city, a large wave gets kicked up. Frozone freezes it to create a cushion for the side of the ship to run into. As such, even though the ship runs aground into the city on a sideways trajectory, it is otherwise brought safely to a stop without significant injury or property damage. Helen turns to Bob and asks if she missed Jack-Jack\\'s first power, and he says more like the first seventeen. Evelyn is led into a police car in handcuffs, and she tells Helen that saving her life doesn\\'t make them right, but Helen is unfazed at her enemy\\'s remark. Bob tells Violet that she should try introducing herself to Tony again. Days later, a judge rules that Supers should be made legal again. At school, Violet walks up to Tony and introduces herself. They chat for a while, getting to know each other again.\\n\\nOne night, Tony walks out of his door and into a car where the Parr family is sitting. They all head off to a theater together. When they get there, they see a group of police cars chasing down a criminal. Violet gets Tony out of the car, hands him money for tickets and popcorn, and tells him to save her a seat. Confused, Tony does as ordered. Violet gets back in the car, and they all put on their suits and masks. Bob pushes a button, transforming the car into a family sized Incredi-wagon. Bob hits the gas, and the family sets off on another adventure together.', 'The tale of Princess Mononoke is a fantasy adventure: an epic struggle between humanity and nature. The story\\'s competing interests-- comprised of cursed monsters, an assortment of people driven by ambition, a selfless hero, and vengeful gods--are remarkable in that there is no villain, instead portraying darkness and hate as it manifests in everyone. (Note: This synopsis describes the English version of the film.)\\n\\nAshitaka and the Demon\\n\\nThe film opens on a view of a mountainous forest shrouded in mist. A voiceover explains ancient gods and giant beasts inhabit the forests, owing their allegiance to the Forest Spirit. The ancient gods once lived harmoniously with humans, but times have changed. The forest is disappearing and now is the age of gods and demons.\\n\\nAshitaka (English: Billy Crudup, Japanese: Yôji Matsuda) is a prince of the dwindling Emishi people living in the eastern forest. He rides his red elk, Yakul, up the hillside from his village passing three girls along the way, including Kaya (English: Tara Strong), his younger sister (or, in the Japanese version, the girl Ashitaka has promised to marry). He tells the girls that the village oracle, Hii-sama (Japanese: Mitsuko Mori), has sensed trouble and is ordering everyone back to the village. Kaya tells him the old man Ji-san noticed something from his watchtower, so Ashitaka rides to see him. Ashitaka climbs the tower and watches as a creature covered in wormy tendrils violently emerges from the forest. In the sun, it\\'s revealed to be a massive boar that has turned into a demon: a tatari gami. It knocks down the tower but Ashitaka and Ji-san leap to safety before Ashitaka pursues it on Yakul.\\n\\nHe pleads with the demon to spare their village, but the boar doesn\\'t listen. When it attacks the three village girls, Ashitaka is forced to intervene, killing it with two of his arrows. During the fight, the demon\\'s tendrils latch onto Ashitaka\\'s right arm and, with the killing blow, dissolve, burning his skin. Villagers rush up the hill, one of them carrying the elderly oracle. She gives Ashitaka some water to pour over his arm before bowing before the boar, promising to perform rites and asking it to bear them no ill will. The demon bitterly responds, saying they will know its hate and grief. It dies, decomposing into a skeleton.\\n\\nThat evening Hii-sama calls the village elders together in her hut and performs a divination using fortune stones to interpret the day\\'s events. She tells Ashitaka to show his scarred arm to the others and asks if he\\'s ready to hear his fate. When Ashitaka states his resolve, she reveals the scar will spread and eventually kill him. However, instead of waiting to die, he can rise to meet his fate. She gives him an iron ball recovered from the boar\\'s body, believing it to be the cause of his demonic transformation. The oracle tells Ashitaka to ride to the west to see with eyes unclouded but warns him he can never return. Ashitaka agrees, cutting his topknot as a symbol of his separation, and leaves.\\n\\nAs he rides Yakul out of the village, Kaya approaches him, breaking the taboo of seeing a banished person. She gives him her crystal dagger necklace. Ashitaka thanks her and says he will never forget her. He rides off, Kaya staring after him.\\n\\nThe Strength of the Curse\\n\\nAshitaka and Yakul travel many miles westward, across plains and mountains. One day, they see smoke in the distance and discover samurai soldiers fighting with unarmed villagers. Ashitaka rushes to the defense of a woman but, as he pulls back on his bow, his arm throbs visibly and when the arrow is released it flies with such force that it takes the samurai\\'s sword and lodges it in a tree, with the man\\'s arms still attached. Two samurai on horseback threaten to intercept Ashitaka. He yells at them to let him pass, but when they refuse, he releases another arrow, decapitating one. The other watches Ashitaka flee, convinced he\\'s a demon.\\n\\nAs he cools his right arm under a small waterfall, Ashitaka notices the mark is growing. In a town, Ashitaka attempts to buy rice with a gold nugget. The seller refuses it at first, saying it isn\\'t money, but a monk named Jigo (English: Billy Bob Thornton, Japanese: Kaoru Kobayashi) remarks that the nugget is pure gold and worth several bags of rice. Ashitaka quickly leaves the growing crowd with his single bag.\\n\\nJigo follows Ashitaka as he leaves town, commenting that he noticed Ashitaka\\'s fighting skills against the samurai earlier. They see some thugs following them, no doubt after Ashitaka\\'s gold, and Jigo proposes a quick getaway. They camp together later, cooking their rice, and Jigo mentions an ancient people called the Emishi who made bowls and arrows like Ashitaka\\'s and who were rumored to ride red elk like Ashitaka\\'s, though he hints he\\'ll keep the prince\\'s secret. Ashitaka tells Jigo about his experience with the boar demon and his quest to discover its origins and shows Jigo the iron ball. Jigo doesn\\'t think much of Ashitaka\\'s curse (\"You\\'re under a curse? So what? So\\'s the whole damn world\"), but he does tell him of a mining town further to the west, surrounded by ancient forests where giant gods still dwell. The next morning Ashitaka leaves quietly to continue his journey alone while Jigo sleeps.\\n\\nGods and Spirits\\n\\nOn a rain-slicked mountainside, a caravan of oxen and men carrying rice moves along a narrow path. Their leader, Lady Eboshi (English: Minnie Driver, Japanese: Yûko Tanaka), keeps watch with her first lieutenant, Gonza (English: John DiMaggio, Japanese: Tsunehiko Kamijô). Suddenly she notices two giant, white wolves charging down the muddy slope. A masked girl rides one of them, holding her spear high. Eboshi orders her men to open fire with their ishibiya, or hand cannons. The shots drive off the wolves and Gonza remarks that they weren\\'t so big. Eboshi responds that they were just pups; \"wait till you see their mother.\"\\n\\nAs if on cue, Moro (English: Gillian Anderson, Japanese: Akihiro Miwa) attacks the caravan, sending people and oxen tumbling down the mountain. Moro is more than twice the size of her pups and has two tails. The guards use a flame-thrower to set her on fire and Lady Eboshi shoots her in the chest, sending her off the cliff. The surviving men are pleased with themselves, but Eboshi reminds them that it takes more than that to kill a god. She urges the survivors onward and tells them to forget about those who fell.\\n\\nMeanwhile, at the base of the mountain, Ashitaka arrives at a river swollen from the rainfall. He sees bodies floating by and pulls out two injured men, casualties from Lady Eboshi\\'s rice caravan. Ashitaka notices the massive body of Moro on the other side of the river, along with her pups. He watches as the warrior girl, San (English: Akihiro Miwa, Japanese: Yuriko Ishida), tends to Moro, trying to suck the bullet from her wound and spitting out blood. Moro\\'s growling alerts San to Ashitaka\\'s presence. He introduces himself and asks if they are ancient gods. San tells him to go away before disappearing into the forest with the wolves.\\n\\nA scream brings Ashitaka back to where he left the injured men. One of them, Kouroku the ox-driver (English: John DeMita, Japanese: Masahiko Nishimura), has woken up and is trying to get away from a small white spirit with a bobbing head, despite his broken leg and arm. Ashitaka calms him and tells him that it\\'s a kodama, a tree spirit, and it--and the others that begin to appear--are a sign that the forest is healthy. However, Kouroku is worried the creature will bring its master, a large forest spirit. Ashitaka politely asks the kodama for safe passage through the forest and carries the unconscious man, a gunner, while Kouroku rides Yakul.\\n\\nThe kodama lead them to a beautiful and mysterious part of the wood where mossy trees grow among pools of clear water. Ashitaka sees the footprints of San and the wolves. He sets the gunner down to fetch some water and notices the tracks of a three-toed animal he doesn\\'t recognize. He scans the area and spots a herd of deer followed closely by one with many antlers. It stops and Ashitaka\\'s arm suddenly throbs and moves on its own. He struggles to subdue it but only regains control when the mysterious deer vanishes. After the incident, Ashitaka notices the gunner he\\'s carrying seems a bit lighter.\\n\\nIron Town\\n\\nThey emerge from the forest where they see the iron town Tatara, a large settlement across a lake. The town is protected by a tall wooden stockade. They are welcomed by a crowd and Kouroku explains how Ashitaka rescued them. Gonza approaches and demands to know who Ashitaka is and how he managed to walk through the forbidden forest with two injured men. He is cut short when Kouroku\\'s wife, Toki (English: Jada Pinkett Smith, Japanese: Sumi Shimamoto), runs down and berates Kouroku for getting injured and risking his livelihood. She takes a moment to thank Ashitaka before criticizing Gonza for not taking better care of his men. Lady Eboshi appears above and apologizes to Kouroko and Toki before inviting Ashitaka to see her later so she can thank him.\\n\\nAshitaka eats with the men of Iron Town. Some of the women stop by and invite him to see where they work. They heckle the men before leaving, giggling to themselves. The women are former prostitutes, the men explain; Lady Eboshi buys the contracts of every brothel girl she finds. However, since fearless Eboshi came to Tatara, things have changed for the better. They tell of Nago, the boar god who once ruled the forest surrounding the town. Nago became enraged when the men cut trees down to get at the ore beneath the ground and often attacked with his herd of boars. When Eboshi came with her gunners, she set fire to the forest and shot Nago. Ashitaka\\'s arm swells in anger as he realizes that it was Nago who inflicted his cursed wound, and Lady Eboshi who turned Nago into a demon.\\n\\nAshitaka finds Lady Eboshi inspecting samples of iron set to go out with the next shipment, Gonza at her side. He removes his sleeve and shows Eboshi his arm, confronting her about her role in his curse. Eboshi doesn\\'t deny her responsibility but asks Ashitaka\\'s intentions. When he responds \"to see with eyes unclouded by hate,\" Eboshi laughs and agrees to show Ashitaka her secrets. She leaves Gonza in charge and takes Ashitaka to her private garden where she\\'s enlisted a group of lepers to serve as gunsmiths for her. They conjure new guns inspired by the Chinese inside their own hut. Eboshi explains the guns are for the women in the fort, for their protection. She apologizes to Ashitaka again for inflicting his curse, but Ashitaka is angered by Eboshi\\'s production of weapons and asks how much more hate she\\'ll spread. His arm attempts to draw his sword but Ashitaka holds it down, saying that he wouldn\\'t hesitate to kill her to lift the curse, but he fears it wouldn\\'t stop there. An elderly leper asks Ashitaka to have mercy on Lady Eboshi because she took pity on the lepers, caring for them and sheltering them when no one else would. He says life is hard, it is cursed, but still people find ways to keep living.\\n\\nUp on the stockade Eboshi tests her new gun, firing onto the hillside and scattering a tribe of apes attempting to plant new trees. Eboshi asks Ashitaka to live in Tatara; once she kills the Forest Spirit all the other gods will be reduced to lumbering beasts and Princess Mononoke (which means vengeful spirit--she\\'s referring to the wolf girl San) will be human. Eboshi explains San lives to kill her. It\\'s said the blood of the Forest Spirit can grant immortality and Eboshi theorizes that it can cure her lepers--and maybe Ashitaka\\'s curse. Ashitaka leaves and visits the forge where he tries out the bellows. The women are eager to show him and Toki assures him that, despite the hard work, their lives are better here than in the brothels.\\n\\nSan Attacks\\n\\nMeanwhile San and her two wolf brothers approach Tatara. They rush down the hill and San is vaulted over the stockade and into the fort. She races over rooftops, making her way to the top of the forge. Having sensed her presence, Ashitaka runs to meet her while Eboshi leads two women into the center square, each carrying the new guns. As Eboshi prepares her trap, Ashitaka begs San not to throw her life away but, at the sound of a wolf\\'s howl, she rushes forward. A gun blast at her feet sends her plummeting off the roof and a second shot from Eboshi\\'s women breaks the mask off her face, knocking her unconscious. Ashitaka uses the incredible strength of his cursed arm to rip a beam from the roof and halt the crowd before they can get to San. He shakes her awake but she attacks him and runs to Eboshi. San and Eboshi duel, surrounded by the cheering mob.\\n\\nHis anger growing, Ashitaka walks forward, his hate manifesting as ghostly tendrils from his arm. He easily bends the sword of Gonza, who is now convinced Ashitaka is in league with San. Ashitaka pushes his way through the crowd before grabbing San\\'s arm and stopping Eboshi\\'s onslaught with his sword hand. As the tendrils on his arm grow, he calls to the onlookers: \"This is what hate looks like. It\\'s eating me alive, and soon it will kill me. Fear and anger only make it grow faster.\"\\n\\nBut Eboshi grows tired of his curse, quipping that she\\'ll cure him by removing his arm, and swings at him with a small dagger. Ashitaka knocks both her and San out to stop them from fighting. He hands Lady Eboshi to her people and says he\\'s taking San away. One of the women, upset at his treatment of Lady Eboshi, aims her gun and orders him not to move. Ashitaka calmly walks away but the gun goes off, passing through his body. However, Ashitaka\\'s curse keeps him alive and he keeps walking towards the gate. When the guards won\\'t open the gate, saying it takes ten men to lift it, Ashitaka opens it himself despite bleeding profusely. San\\'s wolf brothers wait just outside. Ashitaka tells them he\\'s bringing San out to them, and he leaves Tatara with San and Yakul with a final thanks to the townsfolk.\\n\\nYakul carries Ashitaka and the unconscious San on the mountainside. Soon, however, the loss of blood causes Ashitaka to fall from Yakul and San awakes in time to see him fall. One of San\\'s brothers attacks Ashitaka but San calls him off before confronting Ashitaka about stopping her from killing Eboshi. She holds his sword to his throat but he tells her to live and that she\\'s beautiful. This shocks San but she is then interrupted by the ape clan who want to eat Ashitaka in order to become strong enough to regrow the forest. San\\'s brothers chase the apes away when they insult San since she is human. She then convinces her brothers to leave Ashitaka with her. San calls Yakul, whose trust she gains, to her to help carry Ashitaka into the forest.\\n\\nIn the Domain of the Forest Spirit\\n\\nWith Yakul\\'s help, San takes the unconscious Ashitaka to the heart of the Forest Spirit\\'s domain, where they cross the lake to an island. The island is the forest\\'s holy of holies, and Yakul will not set foot on it; a wise move as noted by San. She leaves Ashitaka lying half in the water with his head pillowed on the soft moss of the island and sticks a sapling she cut into the ground by his head. She removes Yakul\\'s harness, telling him he\\'s free, before swimming away. The little kodamas watch the humans before turning their attention to the horizon as a huge figure comes into view: the Night Walker, the Forest Spirit\\'s two-legged nighttime form. They greet it with the clattering noise made by their rotating heads. The Night Walker lowers itself into the clearing where Ashitaka lies.\\n\\nOn a mountainside some way off, Jigo watches the Night Walker from a hideaway, dressed in a bear skin. He points it out to his fellow hunters and explains that is the reason they\\'re out there, despite their superstitious fears. Jigo shows them the notice from the Emperor giving them permission to hunt the Forest Spirit. They watch as the Spirit resumes its deer-like form. On the island, the Forest Spirit walks over to look upon Ashitaka. It accepts the sapling as an offering and breathes on it, causing it to wither and die.\\n\\nAs Jigo and his hunters climb down the mountain, they see hundreds of boars coming up an adjacent one. The hunters recognize the herd as one not native to the area before they see the leader: the giant, white boar god, Lord Okkoto (English: Keith David, Japanese: Hisaya Morishige). Jigo and the hunters run when Okkoto lets out a roar, realizing he is aware of them.\\n\\nAshitaka wakes from a dream-like vision where he is under water as the Forest Spirit touches his wound, stopping the bleeding. He touches his side to find the bullet wound is gone, though Nago\\'s curse remains on his arm and has even spread to his hand. San returns to him and tells him that she knows all about him and his village, thanks to Yakul, and agrees to help him since the Forest Spirit spared his life. She offers Ashitaka meat jerky, but he\\'s too weak to chew it. San chews for him and passes the food from her mouth to his. The act brings tears to Ashitaka\\'s eyes.\\n\\nMoro arrives with San\\'s brothers, then Okkoto\\'s herd of boars. They say they\\'ve come to kill humans and save the forest and demand to know why there are humans in the Forest Spirit\\'s woods. San is spared their ridicule as Moro\\'s daughter and she explains the Forest Spirit healed Ashitaka. The boars are furious; why would the Forest Spirit spare a human but not Nago, their previous leader? Moro says the Forest Spirit\\'s reasons are his own. As Moro herself has been wounded by the humans, she will likely die in the forest at the behest of the Forest Spirit. Ashitaka confesses it was he who killed Nago and shows his cursed hand. Okkoto then comes forward and, despite being blind, inspects Ashitaka\\'s hand, sniffing at it. He believes his story, saddened that a demon came from their tribe. He then tells Moro how he plans to attack the humans and, though they likely will not win, will keep fighting to the last and leave the humans in awe. After the boars leave, San and Ashitaka see the Forest Spirit walking on the water of the lake.\\n\\nA Skirmish\\n\\nA battle rages near Tatara; Lady Eboshi and her men are fighting Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the ore-rich lands. However, Asano\\'s men are decimated by Eboshi\\'s gunfire. As Eboshi returns to Tatara, she meets Jigo, who accompanies her into the fort. Lady Eboshi tells Jigo that Lord Asano has offered to back off if she gives him half her iron but, as a messenger arrives at the gates, she shuts the door and leaves her women to taunt the horseman.\\n\\n\"You want some of our iron? Here you go!\" They shoot at the messenger, who flees.\\n\\nJigo laughs at the women\\'s bravado before introducing the note sent from the Mikado (the emperor) himself requesting the head of the Forest Spirit for a large sum. The emperor believes that the head will give him immortal life and Jigo is keen to collect the reward with Eboshi\\'s help. If she refuses he alludes to the fact that his small army of rifleman could be put to better use alongside Asano\\'s forces. Lady Eboshi shows the Mikado\\'s letter to her women who have no idea who the emperor is, demonstrating that out here the Mikado has no true power; it lies in the strength of her people. She tells Jigo she will help him hunt the Forest Spirit and tells him that it will be done her way, with no loss of human life, and requests that he remove his riflemen from their hiding place in the hills. Jigo laughs at her cunning.\\n\\nBefore she goes, he asks Eboshi whether a young man riding an elk came to Tatara.\\n\\n\"Came, and went,\" Lady Eboshi replies.\\n\\nJigo\\'s riflemen take up residence in the fort and are regarded with suspicion due to their solemn nature. Eboshi meets with her women and explains that they must remain in the fort and defend against Asano, since she doesn\\'t trust the men. Gonza assures them he\\'ll protect Eboshi but the women scorn him, saying, \"That\\'s what we\\'re afraid of.\"\\n\\nMoro\\'s Cave\\n\\nAshitaka wakes in Moro\\'s cave, high above the trees, and finds San sleeping beside him. He gets up, his arm throbbing, and walks out onto the rock ledge to look down on the forest. Moro, perched on the rocks above him, suggests that he jump to end his pain. Ashitaka asks what\\'s been happening and Moro tells him that he\\'s been asleep for days. She\\'s sorry he didn\\'t cry out in his sleep because then she would have felt justified in biting his head off to keep him quiet. The boars are on the move, Moro says, and she can feel the pain of the forest as it dies beneath their rampaging feet.\\n\\nAshitaka asks why the humans and the forest can\\'t live together in peace but Moro laughs, saying such a thing can\\'t happen. She longs for the day when she can kill Eboshi. There will be a battle, she predicts, and San will fight alongside the gods and die with them. When Ashitaka objects, saying that she\\'s human, Moro becomes angry and reveals that she once attacked some humans who invaded the forest. In their terror, the people threw their baby at Moro. The baby was San; Moro kept her and raised her. Though she loves San, Moro understands that San will never fully belong anywhere--either to the wolves or the humans--and there\\'s nothing Moro or Ashitaka can do about that. Moro tells Ashitaka to leave her cave by dawn; if he comes back she\\'ll kill him.\\n\\nWhen Ashitaka wakes up again in the cave it\\'s broad daylight and San and Moro are gone. Ashitaka gathers his things, finding supplies neatly left for him. Still very weak, he stumbles down to Yakul. One of the wolf brothers escorts him out of the forest and on to a path to Tatara. Ashitaka throws Kaya\\'s crystal dagger necklace to the wolf, asking him to give it to San.\\n\\nA Battle\\n\\nSan rides her wolf brother to meet Moro on a mountainside overlooking a barren hillside where Eboshi\\'s men have cut down trees and built fires stinking with sulfur to blunt the animals\\' sense of smell in anticipation of battle with the forest gods. Moro recognizes the trap; the boars will run straight to the humans, blinded and enraged by the felled trees. Okkoto is too stubborn to change his tactics and will run head-on. San says she\\'s going to help Okkoto; she feels that with neither eyes nor sense of smell to depend on, Lord Okkoto needs her more than Moro does. Moro tells San that she can go away with Ashitaka if she wants--\"that boy wanted to share his life with you.\" San replies bitterly that she hates humans. But when her second brother arrives and gives her Ashitaka\\'s necklace, she seems touched at the gift. San puts it around her neck as she says goodbye to Moro, who will go and wait for the Forest Spirit. San and the young wolves go off together to join the boars, who are running headlong into battle.\\n\\nAshitaka rides towards Tatara, dejected, before he hears the explosions set off by the rampaging boars. However, closer gunfire draws his attention and he discovers that Tatara is under siege. As he nears the town, some samurai try to stop him. Yakul leaps over them, jumps into the lake, and swims for Tatara as Ashitaka deflects the samurais\\' arrows with his sword. They find that Asano\\'s men have breached the outer wall of Tatara and the women are holed up in the center, still defending the fort. They ask Ashitaka to carry word of their plight to Lady Eboshi and bring her back. Kouroku returns Ashitaka\\'s bow and arrows.\\n\\nAshitaka rides off, pursued by samurai on horseback. As he crosses the mountains he comes to one smoking from the remains of the boar battle. A samurai shoots an arrow into Yakul\\'s haunch. His anger increasing and his curse spreading, Ashitaka stops to fight. His arrows take the arm off one samurai and decapitate another before the remaining samurai rides off. Ashitaka pulls the arrow out of Yakul\\'s hindquarters and tries to leave him behind, saying he\\'ll come back for him later, but Yakul limps along behind him.\\n\\nThey reach the part of the battlefield where Lady Eboshi\\'s men and a few of Jigo\\'s mercenaries are burying their dead. Ashitaka sees men covered in cloth awaiting burial and dead boars piled everywhere. He is told by an iron worker that they were used as bait; boars came at them, igniting mines buried underground while grenades were dropped by mercenaries from above. Ashitaka learns that San was in the battle but she is not among the dead. He then tells the men that Tatara is being attacked and he needs to deliver a message to Eboshi. Two mercenaries demand the men get back to work digging but the iron workers argue, saying they must return to Tatara and that a tracker must be sent for Eboshi. Ashitaka then finds one of San\\'s wolf brothers pinned under a boar and attempts to free him. Seeing this as treason, the mercenaries try to subdue Ashitaka with poisoned darts but the iron workers revolt against them and help Ashitaka free the wolf. Ashitaka leaves Yakul in the care of the iron workers and runs off with the wolf towards the forest.\\n\\nAn Ambush\\n\\nIn the forest, a hunter reports to Jigo and Lady Eboshi that Lord Okkoto is badly wounded and heading for the domain of the Forest Spirit; San is with him.\\n\\nSan walks with Okkoto and her other wolf brother. Okkoto is bleeding heavily and losing strength. He stops as a clan of ape gods appear in the trees overhead, throwing sticks and claiming that San\\'s actions have brought terrible things into the forest: \"Bad things coming--neither human or animal.\" San is unable to smell anything over the blood and can only watch as small animals run from the oncoming threat. A boar appears behind them, followed by many others, but they slither across the ground unnaturally. San realizes they\\'re humans wearing boar skins. Okkoto believes them to be his warriors returned from the dead. Renewed but delirious, he walks on towards the domain of the Forest Spirit.\\n\\nSan fears that Okkoto will become a demon; like Nago before him, he\\'s defeated, mortally wounded, and filled with fear and hate. She sends her wolf brother to tell Moro what\\'s happening but stays with Okkoto herself, hoping to avert his change, but there\\'s nothing she can do. San begs him to stop, but Okkoto ignores her and soon his anger and fear begin to bubble out of him in bloody tendrils as he transforms into a demon.\\n\\nAs she fends off the \\'ghost boars\\', San hears one of her wolf brothers howling a message: Ashitaka is looking for her. An answering howl from the other brother tells Ashitaka that San is in danger, more true than they know--San is knocked out by a hunter\\'s slingshot and sucked into the tendrils covering Okkoto. Demon-Okkoto resumes his rush toward the heart of the forest.\\n\\nAshitaka mounts the wolf to move faster and soon comes upon Lady Eboshi. He dismounts to tell Eboshi to halt her death march and return to help Tatara before running ahead, but Lady Eboshi, intent on finding and killing the Forest Spirit, says the women must take care of themselves and keeps moving. Jigo is confused as to whose side Ashitaka is on. Behind Lady Eboshi\\'s back, some of Jigo\\'s men wonder if they can do without her, but Jigo says killing gods is dangerous business--he\\'s happy to let her do it.\\n\\nAshitaka reaches the Forest Spirit\\'s pool, where he finds Moro dying at the water\\'s edge. Demon-Okkoto arrives, still followed by the hunters in boar skins. San calls to Ashitaka and he can see her struggling on Okkoto\\'s snout, growing demon-tendrils herself. Ashitaka leaps onto Okkoto\\'s snout and tries to dig San out while the wolf brothers fight off the hunters, but Ashitaka is thrown off by the demon before he can get to San. He bounces off of Moro and lands in the water, stunned. Moro, who was saving the last of her strength to fight Lady Eboshi, rouses herself to confront the demon and drags San out of the mass of tendrils.\\n\\nAs Moro frees San, the Forest Spirit approaches in its deer form, walking across the water. Jigo and Lady Eboshi can see it from their hiding place. Quelled by its appearance, Okkoto backs away and the tendrils begin to melt. Ashitaka wakes in the water to the sound of Moro\\'s voice asking him to save San. He comes to the surface and sees Lady Eboshi shoot the Forest Spirit, though he cries out to her to stop. The Forest Spirit stops and sinks a bit when it\\'s hit, but recovers and keeps walking. Ashitaka takes San from Moro and returns to the water to wash the demon tendrils from her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Forest Spirit takes the lives of Okkoto and Moro, to the surprise of the humans. Eboshi comments that life and death are his to give and take. The Forest Spirit begins to make its change into the Night Walker and Eboshi turns to the hunters.\\n\\n\"Watch closely, everyone. I\\'m going to show you how to kill a god,\" says Lady Eboshi. \"The trick is not to fear him.\"\\n\\nSeeing her take aim, Ashitaka throws his sword and hits her ishibiya, which only distracts her for a moment. The Forest Spirit looks at Lady Eboshi and plants sprout from the wooden parts of her gun, but this doesn\\'t stop her either. She fires and hits the half-transformed Forest Spirit in the neck, separating its head which falls to the ground. Horrible black goo spouts from the neck, killing whatever it falls on. Dead kodamas fall from the trees all around. Lady Eboshi grabs the severed head and gives it to Jigo. Porters come up carrying a round metal box. Jigo puts the head in the box and they run off.\\n\\nHuman Hands\\n\\nMoro\\'s head, apparently detached from her body by the black ooze, wriggles forward and bites off Lady Eboshi\\'s arm before bouncing away into the ooze. While San and her brothers take refuge on the Forest Spirit\\'s holy island, Ashitaka takes Eboshi and swims to the island with her while Gonza wades after him, having never learned to swim. San rips the crystal necklace from around her neck and orders Ashitaka to let her kill Eboshi, but he assures San that Moro\\'s revenge has been taken and tells Eboshi he promised the women he\\'d return her to them. Angry at Ashitaka, San stabs him with the dagger but he hugs her close, saying that despite everything they\\'re still alive and can still save the forest, if she\\'ll help him.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Night Walker prowls the forest in search of its head, spreading black ooze and destruction with every step. It grows reaching arms from its neck and sends them down into the forest, chasing after Jigo and the three porters.\\n\\nIn Tatara, it\\'s quiet. The women are guarding the walls and keeping an eye on Lord Asano\\'s camp while one of the leper gunsmiths fixes Toki\\'s ishibiya. Looking up at the mountain, they see the headless Night Walker and its tide of black, killing ooze coming over the ridge toward the town. It destroys Lord Asano\\'s encampments and keeps coming. Ashitaka, San, and her wolf brothers arrive and Ashitaka tells the women and the lepers to get in the lake to escape the ooze. Urged on by Toki, most of the people manage to get away before the ooze overruns the town. Standing in the water, they watch as the forge catches fire and burns.\\n\\nSan, Ashitaka, and the wolves go after Jigo and the head. When they catch Jigo, Ashitaka demands that the head be returned to the Night Walker. Jigo pleads to keep it, noting the sun is about to rise, before he attacks Ashitaka and tells the other porters to run. San chases them but they are stopped by the Forest Spirit. In their fear, they drop the metal box and it rolls down the hill. Jigo stops it, tumbling down the hill a ways and coming to rest on a large rock. San, Ashitaka, and one porter catch up to him as a tide of ooze surrounds them. Ashitaka convinces him there\\'s nothing else to be done and says \"human hands must return it.\" Jigo opens the box and Ashitaka and San hold the head up, begging the Forest Spirit to take it and be at peace. The Spirit leans forward and takes its head back, showering them all in a bright light.\\n\\nOn the lake, the Tatara refugees watch the Night Walker straighten up with its head back in place and resume its usual appearance of starry transparency. Rafts approach carrying Lady Eboshi, Gonza, and the rest of the iron town men; the two groups are happily reunited.\\n\\nWithout having returned to its glade before sunrise, the Night Walker collapses at the dawn, falling on Tatara and blowing much of it away in a strong wind. The burning remains of the town and Asano\\'s camp fly away into the barren hills which slowly turn green with new growth and sprouting plants. Kouroku looks on in amazement and the lepers look down at themselves to find they\\'ve been healed.\\n\\nYakul, who arrived on the rafts with the men, finds San and Ashitaka asleep in the grass beside her wolf brothers. Yakul wakes them and they find that the Forest Spirit has disappeared. San is distraught at the Forest Spirit\\'s death but Ashitaka assures her it cannot die, since it is life itself. He looks at his hand which is scarred, but curse free. San tells Ashitaka that she likes him but cannot forgive humans for what they\\'ve done. He understands and tells her that he will live at Tatara and help them rebuild so that they can live alongside the forest and will visit her often. San nods and departs with her brothers.\\n\\nLady Eboshi, recovering from the loss of her arm, is humbly optimistic. Sitting with her women and Gonza, she promises to start anew and build a better town. She sends for Ashitaka to thank him. Jigo, perched on the rocks high above with his one remaining porter, laughs to himself, saying, \"Well, I give up. You can\\'t win against fools.\"\\n\\nAround the dead trees near the Forest Spirit\\'s pool, new trees are growing. Among them walks a little white kodama, rattling its head.', 'In a world of robots, the Copperbottom family has a son, named Rodney. Growing up, Rodney becomes infatuated by famous robotics inventor Big Weld, and decides that he wants to be an inventor and work for Big Weld industries one day.\\n\\nRodney spends his youth and teenage years trying to perfect his own helper robot. He attempts to show his Dad that the robot can help him wash dishes, but helper ends up causing more damage than help.\\n\\nDetermined to make something of himself and pay off the damages the helper bot caused, Rodney decides to head to Robot City to fulfill his dream and work for Big Weld Industries.\\n\\nUpon reaching Robot City, Rodney finds the gates to Big Weld Industries shut, with no new ideas coming in. The company, now led by a robot named Ratchet, has also scrapped the business model of supplying spare parts for older robot models, and going with pricier upgrades for robots, with a new slogan titled, \"Why be you, when you can be new.\"\\n\\nAfter being kicked out of Big Weld Industries, Rodney finds himself in a darker side of town, where a strange robot named Fender attempts to make off with his foot. Rodney chases after him, and finds a small collective of older robots scrounging for spare parts. In the ensuing chaos, Fender loses a part for his neck, and when the group goes to find a replacement part, finds this item has been discontinued. Even though Fender attempted to cannibalize him, Rodney helps Fender and manages to make a suitable neck replacement out of additional spare parts.\\n\\nFender\\'s sister, Piper, explains that many robots in Robot City are in desperate need of spare parts that Big Weld Industries used to make. However, in recent months, Big Weld has disappeared; the streets are now patrolled by motorized vehicles, known as Sweepers, that take obsolete models to a dark side of town known as the Chop Shop, run by Madam Gasket (Ratchet\\'s mother). Any collected models never come back.\\n\\nRodney bunks with the group and another robot named Aunt Fanny, but is surprised the next day when the local parts shop closes its doors, claiming that all spare parts orders from Big Weld Industries have officially dried up. All sorts of robot citizens are up in arms, but Rodney comes forward, and using what spare parts are left, helps those less fortunate.\\n\\nSoon, the parts loss is felt at home, as Rodney receives a letter from his parents, saying that without spare parts, his father will not survive. Word soon reaches Rodney about an annual company ball held by Big Weld Industries. Rodney and Fender break into the festivities in hopes to talk to Big Weld and convince him to help, since Big Weld always attends this function.\\n\\nHowever, Ratchet appears claiming that Big Weld couldn\\'t attend. Rodney then comes forward, demanding to know where Big Weld is, and brings to the company\\'s attention the plight of the average bot, of whom Rodney has spent several days trying to repair countless numbers of.\\n\\nRatchet orders Rodney be captured, but he, Fender, and a female employee named Cappy manage to escape the party. Fender parts ways with the group, while Rodney and Cappy head to Big Weld\\'s mansion to investigate. Rodney is at first excited to meet his childhood hero, but soon grows disillusioned when Big Weld tells him to give up his fight to fix the outmoded robots. Big Weld claims that in the face of change for Big Weld Industries, Ratchet took over, turning the company into an entity that was more about profits than helping others.\\n\\nRodney then heads to the train station intent on going home, when the other robots and Fender appear. Fender, having just survived almost being destroyed in the Chop Shop, has overheard of the Sweepers being deployed in full force the next day by Madame Gasket and Ratchet to collect all the outmoded robots in Robot City.\\n\\nBig Weld also shows up, and inspires the group not to give up; they all return to Big Weld Industries to confront Ratchet; Big Weld (inspired by the bots still believing in him) fires Ratchet, who weeps and begs for another chance; caught off-guard, Big Weld succumbs to a knockout punch from Ratchet, who then realizes he\\'s become as crazy as his own mother!\\n\\nSecurity arrives to remove Big Weld just as Rodney and Cappy turn up; between them they help Big Weld escape the building and end up being chased across Robot City, eventually ending up outside Madam Gasket\\'s Chop Shop (although Big Weld goes shooting through the gates to the inside).\\n\\nThe group all tool up and enter the Chop Shop to rescue Big Weld from a certain melting down, but are faced with Madam Gasket, Ratchet and the army of new-fangled Sweepers. Piper turns up with all of the city\\'s outmoded robots; working together, they attack Madam Gasket\\'s outfit and rescue Big Weld. Madam Gasket gets melted down and Ratchet gets strung up in chains (next to his poor hen-pecked father) simultaneously losing his flashy upgrades! Big Weld, Piper, Fender and the others all celebrate a victory.\\n\\nRodney returns home (with Big Weld) and brings enough spare parts for his ailing parents; Rodney has been made Big Weld\\'s right-hand bot, and eventual successor!', 'In New Orleans, a young girl named Tiana ( Elizabeth M. Dampier) and her mother are visiting the La Bouff family, where Tiana\\'s mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is crafting a dress for the family\\'s daughter, Charlotte (Breanna Brooks). Charlotte is a lover of fairy tales, and Eudora reads the two the story of \"The Frog Prince.\" While Charlotte is enamoured with kissing a frog that becomes a prince, Tiana finds the thought disgusting.\\n\\nUpon returning home, Tiana helps her father, James (Terrence Howard) prepare gumbo. As the meal is finished, her father tells of his dream to one day open his own restaurant. When Tiana eagerly chimes in that she wants to help, her father claims they\\'ll call it Tiana\\'s Place. Upon seeing the Evening Star outside her window, Tiana makes a wish, to which her father explains that wishing can only go so far, and that she has to help that wish along.\\n\\nAs time passes, Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) holds onto the dream, even after her father has passed away. Working two different jobs, Tiana spends almost all of her time working and saving for a place, with little time for friends or fun. One morning, she runs into Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) and her father \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff (John Goodman), who has been named King of the Mardi Gras for the fifth year in a row. Charlotte is incredibly excited that a visiting prince named Naveen (Bruno Campos) is in New Orleans. As Naveen is single, Charlotte hopes to fulfill her wish of marrying a prince and living happily ever after, and has invited him to attend a social function at the family mansion.\\n\\nKnowing of Tiana\\'s cooking skills, Charlotte pays her friend a large sum of money to cater the event. Tiana is pleased, as the money is just enough to allow her to purchase the place to start her restaurant. Tiana contacts the building\\'s owners and shows the place to her mother. While Eudora is pleased, she is worried that Tiana seems to have no time for herself, with her one-mindedness regarding the restaurant.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Prince Naveen is entertaining a crowd; playing the ukelele with a band, and dancing. His assistant Lawrence (Peter Bartlett) angrily comes up to him, complaining that the two would be late for the La Bouff\\'s masquerade. Naveen brushes the issue off, and offers to buy everyone in the crowd a drink, but Lawrence reveals that the prince is broke. His only options of fixing his financial state are to marry a wealthy young lady, or get a job. Relucantly, Naveen agrees, but a spectactle soon ensues, resulting in the two landing dizzily on the footpath. A tall man, introducing himself as Dr. Facilier (Keith David) greets them, and hands Naveen a business card reading \\'Tarot Readings, Charms, Potions, Dreams Made Real\\', before pretending to read the prince\\'s palm and recognising him as a royal. Naveen eagerly informs Lawrence of Facilier\\'s feat, but the assistant grabs a newspaper with the prince\\'s face printed on it, from the witch doctor\\'s back pocket and calls him a charlatan. Facilier has a brief flash of anger, before he regains his composure and invites the others into his shop. Naveen and Lawrence each take three of his tarot cards. Facilier looks at Naveen\\'s cards, and deduces that he is from across the sea, and despite being royalty has little money, due to his parents cutting off his funds. He says the prince needs to marry a rich young woman, but this would conflict with his urges to be free. Lastly, the Shadow Man states that although freedom takes money, he sees the prince being wealthy in his future. He then moves onto Lawrence, and after inspecting the assistant\\'s cards, concludes that although he has been pushed around by others all his life, he will be the man he always wanted to be; namely, Lawrence being wealthy, powerful and the boss of Naveen. Facilier offers both men his hand, and while Naveen uncertainly shakes it, Lawrence does so with fervour. Quickly, the witch doctor gets down to work, pricking the prince\\'s finger and filling up a small head-shaped talisman with his blood. Transformations begin to change both Naveen and Lawrence, but the scene darkens before anything noticeable occurs.\\n\\nAt the La Bouff mansion, Tiana shows up to cater the event, and soon, Prince Naveen arrives. Charlotte eagerly goes to him for a dance. As Tiana watches her friend, she discovers the realtors of the property have also attended the function, as they approach her and the food. Tiana eagerly tells of her wish to sign the papers to the building as .soon as possible, but the two men explain that someone else has offered a larger sum, and are planning to deny her the property, unless she can come up with more money. Upset and heartbroken, Tiana accidentally makes a mess of her outfit. Charlotte, seeing her friend in need, allows her to change out of the outfit, into a blue gown with tiara. While in Charlotte\\'s room, she sees the star shining in the sky, and wishes for help regarding her restaurant. As she looks down, she finds a frog sitting near her, and sarcastically asks it if it wants a kiss. To her surprise, the frog replies, and Tiana screams and races back inside. After unsuccessfully dodging the stuffed animals thrown at him and being smacked with a book, the frog is finally able to tell Tia, that he is Prince Naveen of Maldonia. She then asks him, that if he is Prince Naveen, who is the person dancing with Charlotte downstairs, to which he replies that he has no idea. Suddenly, he spots the name of the book Tiana is holding; The Frog Prince. He, under the impression that Tia is a princess, tells her that like what happens in the book, if she kisses him, he will turn back into a prince. She abruptly refuses, but when Naveen mentions that his wealthy family might be able to reward her in some way, Tiana thinks about her restaurant, and determindedly plants a kiss on the frog.\\n\\nTo the horror of both parties, not only is Naveen still a frog, but Tia has changed into one two. Shocked and angry, she launches herself at the prince and tackles him, until they both go flying out the window onto a drum set, before falling into the neck of Charlotte\\'s dress. \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff yells for Stella the dog to catch the frogs, who run across a dinner table before escaping via a bunch of balloons.\\n\\nAs the masquerade comes to an abrupt end, the Prince Naveen imposter hurries into a nearby cottage and opens up a cabinet to find an empty jar. Dr. Facilier appears from behind him and accuses him of letting the real prince/frog go. The imposter is revealed to be Lawrence, who can only keep the prince\\'s form if he is wearing the blood-filled talisman around his neck. Lawrence, having second thoughts about the deceit, throws the talisman to Facilier, telling him to wear it instead. The Shadow Man angrily shouts for him to be careful with the object, and then replies that even if he wanted to be the fake prince, the voodoo magic wouldn\\'t work on him. They also discuss their plan; Lawrence is going to marry Charlotte, then Facilier would dispose of Big Daddy, and their fortune would be shared.\\n\\nStill clutching onto the balloon strings, Tiana discovers that the reason why Naveen was changed into a frog was because he was messing with voodoo, and stubbornly states that the only way to get things in life is through hard work. Taken aback, Naveen questions why a princess would ever have to work, and Tia replies that she\\'s a waitress not a princess. Outraged, the prince exclaims that that was why the kiss didn\\'t work, and the two engage in a heated argument before the balloons suddenly pop and they are sent falling into a lake. They narrowly escape a large fish and then an aggressive crane, followed by a group of hungry alligators from which they hide in an old tree and spend the night.\\n\\nIn the morning, Tiana makes a small raft so that the two can make their way back to New Orleans and become humans again. To her annoyance, Naveen doesn\\'t help with the paddling, and instead sits and plays a twig-guitar. Tia turns around to give him a piece of her mind, but sees a huge alligator that looks as if it\\'s about to eat up Naveen. To both of the frog\\'s surprise however, the alligator pulls out a trumpet and launches into a jam session with the prince, and introduces himself as Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley). Naveen explains that he and Tiana are both humans, turned into frogs by voodoo magic, to which Louis replies that a woman named Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) is the voodoo queen of the bayou, and she can perform similar feats. As the journey to her lair is so dangerous however, he flatly refuses when the two ask if he can take them there. Disappointed, Tiana is about to return to her paddling, when Naveen hops off the raft and suavely persuades Louis to guide them to Mama Odie\\'s. He says that the witch could probably turn the toothy alligator into a human as well, so that he could fulfill his dream of playing with the jazz musicians of the city. This is too much for Louis, who swiftly agrees to take them there.\\n\\nBack at the La Bouffe\\'s, Charlotte and Lawrence, posing as Prince Naveen have tea together. Suddenly, one of Lawrence\\'s ears appears to swell up, although it has really just returned to it\\'s normal size. Worriedly, he checks the talisman and sees that half of the blood has been used up. He nervously blames his ear on mosquitoes, but just as quickly, his backside enlarges. Lawrence manipulates and maneuvres Charlotte so she can\\'t see his transformation back into his plump self, just as his chin and stomach swell up. To distract her, he hurriedly proposes to her, and Charlotte accepts before happily waltzing away. Dr. Facilier appears from nowhere and watches as all the blood is drained and Lawrence returns entirely to his former body. As the assistant had let Naveen free so that his blood was currently unavailable, the Shadow Man is forced to ask for help from his \\'friends on the other side\\'.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the bayou, Tiana tells Louis about her big plans for the restaurant. Quickly the trio realises their hunger, and the frogs try fruitlessly to catch flies for food. But their inexperience falis their attempt, as Naveen and Tiana\\'s tongues get tied in a knot. Louis tries to help but just makes the knot incredibly more complicated, before hurrying off to get a sharp stick. A firefly zooms down to observe the struggling couple, and chuckles at their discomfort. Soon enough however, he undoes the knot and introduces himself as Ray (Jim Cummings). The two explain their predicament to him, but the firefly says that they\\'re heading in the wrong way if they want to meet Mama Odie. Right on cue, Louis runs in waving a sharp stick in the air but Ray whispers to Tiana to never take directions from an alligator, as they\\'ll always get you lost. He then whistles, and immediately thousands of fireflies light up to show the group the way.\\n\\nDr. Facilier, back in his shop is asking large totem heads on the wall for assistance in retrieving Naveen, but they frown menacingly at his plea. As if expecting their negative answer however, Facilier assures them that as soon as he kills \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff, the \\'friends\\' can have all the souls of New Orleans for themselves. To this, the heads agree, and a multitude of shadows enter the room. Facilier orders them to find Naveen, and bring him back alive... for now.\\n\\nBack at the bayou, Ray is farewelling his relatives as he prepares to go with Tiana, Naveen and Louis the rest of the way. He reveals to Tiana that he is in love with Evangeline, but Naveen advises the firefly to not settle down so quickly. Louis is pricked by a bush and melodramatically wails in pain until Ray calms him down to pull out the thistles. As the group is preoccupied, a trio of hunters lies in wait, planning to catch and eat Tia and Naveen. Unaware of the danger they\\'re in, the two frogs walk away from the others, Tiana in front, chopping away at leaves in her path, and Naveen behind. After being told by Naveen that she doesn\\'t know how to have fun, Tia angrily retorts that he\\'s a lazy good-for-nothing. While they exchange heated words, Naveen is captured in a net by Reggie (Ritchie Montgomery), and Tia by Two Fingers (Paul Briggs). She escapes, just as Louis and Ray spots Reggie in a boat with guns, gloating over the prince. In his terror, Louis accidentally falls back in the thorn bushes, but the firefly flies up the old hunter\\'s nose to distract him and set Naveen free. Running away from Darnell (Don Hall), Tia inadvertently lands herself in a trap box and is promptly sat upon by Reggie to prevent her escape. The prince bobs out of the water, gleeful with his freedom but sees Tiana trapped, and follows the boat. He sits on Reggie\\'s head, causing Darnell to dimwittedly whack his father to try and hit the agile frog. Soon chaos ensues, and Tia is able to get out of her cage.\\n\\nNaveen and Tiana return to Louis and Ray after their ordeal, while the firefly impatiently yanks the thistles out of the pained alligator. To make him feel better, Tia makes swamp gumbo but insists Naveen help by mincing the mushrooms while she gathers peppers. She returns to find him struggling with the task, and smiling, helps him. The prince admits that since his charmed life in the castle, he doesn\\'t know how to do anything. One of the shadows under Facilier\\'s orders, meanwhile, finds flowers as evidence of the frogs and lets out a piercing call. Soon the other shadows follow him and they make their way towards the prince.\\n\\nAfter eating the swamp gumbo, Naveen compliments Tiana\\'s cooking, saying she has a gift to which she thanks him. Ray changes the subject though, pointing to the sky and telling the others that the Evening Star is Evangeline. He sings about his love for her, but when Louis moves to interrupt and tell him that his love is actually a star, Naveen throws a nutshell at him and gestures for him to be quiet. The prince asks Tia to dance with him, but she dejectedly hops to another lilypad and sadly tells him that she doesn\\'t dance. Naveen tugs her back near him however, and quietly tells her that if he can mince, she can dance. They begin dancing on a lilypad to Louis\\'s trumpet, while Ray creates mood lighting. The pair are about to kiss, until Tia pushes him away and remarks that Charlotte was getting herself a superb dance partner. Suddenly, the shadows grab and drag Naveen away, but although the others run after him, it doesn\\'t look like they\\'re fast enough. Bursts of light from nowhere, hit the shadows and destroy them, rendering Naveen free, and as the group looks for their saviour, they meet Mama Odie.\\n\\nShe brings them back to her tree house and introduces them to her pet python Juju, who she uses as a walking stick. Tiana and Naveen try to get her attention to turn them back into humans, but she interrupts each of their attempts, by offering them candy, falling asleep and going to her gumbo pot. Eventually she answers their questions by trying to teach them the difference of wants and needs. Tiana doesn\\'t understand however, so wearily Mama Odie shows them through the gumbo pot, how to turn human again; Naveen will have to kiss Charlotte before midnight, while she\\'s princess of the Mardi Gras parade.\\n\\nThe group decide to make their way to New Orleans by following Louis\\' suggestion, and they sneakily climb aboard the river boat. A group of musicians soon make their way past however, and while Naveen, Ray and Tiana can hide, Louis is too big, and is noticed by them. Luckily for both parties however, the alligator is thought to be a human inside an alligator costume, and excitedly plays the trumpet and follows them. Ray and Tiana go to watch Louis play with \\'the big boys\\', but Naveen mysteriously decides to stay back and says he\\'ll catch up with the others later. He then fashions a ring out of rope and a beaded bracelet, before asking Evangeline why he can\\'t just tell Tiana he loves her. Ray flies in in the wrong moment, and thinking Naveen is making a move on Evangeline begins to pummel him. Naveen quickly sets the record straight, but tells Ray to not tell Tiana about his love for her. Soon after, the prince leads Tia to a private dinner, where she is taken aback but delighted. He treats her to a minced dinner, but due to nerves, begins making mistakes, telling Tia he has dated thousands of women, then calling her one of the guys before tripping and upturning the food. She takes it in her stride though, giggling and saying she thinks it\\'s cute. Naveen is about to propose to her, but Tiana interrupts, pointing out her future restaurant and gushing about her plans for it. When she mentions, however, that she needs the money by the next day, or she\\'ll lose the restaurant forever, the prince realises he cannot marry her and disappointedly heads off. While Tiana talks to Evangeline, telling her about her uncertainty for the future, Naveen is being dragged off once again, by the shadows.\\n\\nCharlotte is seen knocking on a door, calling for Prince Naveen to hurry up for the Mardi Gras wedding, while Lawrence worriedly procrastinates, saying he\\'ll be ready shortly, but itching for Naveen\\'s blood so he can take his form again. The shadows suddenly appear, and toss the prince into Facilier\\'s hat, where they take more of his blood and drip it into the talisman. Back on the river boat, which has docked, everyone\\'s getting off to play at the Mardi Gras, but Tiana asks Ray where Naveen is. Ray lets slip that Naveen loves her, and that he plans to marry her after kissing Charlotte and getting them both turned back into humans. Giddy with joy, Tiana hops around the Mardi Gras, looking for the float where Naveen would be kissing Charlotte, but instead sees the Prince imposter about to marry her. Mistaking Lawrence for the actual prince, Tia is devastated and tunes out Ray as he wonders how it can be true, when Mama Odie specifically said both frogs would be turned human once again.\\n\\nTia hops off sadly, and Ray flies through the city looking for her. Once he does, he tries to comfort her but Tiana angrily bursts out that Evangeline isn\\'t real, and is just a star. Ray tearily tells Evangeline to not listen to Tia, and that she\\'s only speaking out of a broken heart, before flying off to put things right. As Lawrence prepares to wed Charlotte, Facilier chuckles, preparing to kill Big Daddy through the use of a voodoo doll. Ray finds Naveen locked inside a small chest right next to Lawrence, and quickly sets him free. Naveen launches himself at the former assistant, and the two go tumbling off the float. Lawrence runs off to dispose of the frog, but the prince takes the talisman off his neck and throws it to Ray who flies away with it. The shadows and Facilier run after the firefly, and to help him, Louis stops playing and growls, alerting the other musicians that he\\'s an actual alligator. As the crowd screams and parts, Louis runs off to help his friend.\\n\\nRay meanwhile, zooms towards Tiana, and quickly explains the nature of the talisman, claiming it proves that what they saw wasn\\'t the truth. Tiana hops off with the object, while Ray stays behind to destroy as many shadows as possible. With his light, he kills a few of them, but Facilier soon arrives and knocks the firefly to the ground, before disgustedly stepping on him. A few seconds later, Louis comes running, calling for Ray, but finds the firefly lying on the ground and makes off for Tiana.\\n\\nThe shadows and Facilier continue chasing Tiana, but when she threatens to break the talisman into a million pieces, the Shadow Man casts an enchantment on her, causing her to look human again, and changes the setting, to her dream restaurant. She thinks she sees Naveen playing the ukulele in the corner of the room, but when the man turns around, she sees it isn\\'t and is disappointed. Facilier meanwhile, tries to convince Tia to hand over the artifact, promising the restaurant and becoming a human again. When she refuses to, he brings up memories of her sacrifices and people doubting her abilities, and finally her father working hard but failing to get enough money for a restaurant. Facilier tells Tiana that she could get everything that her father ever wanted, but she determinedly tells the witch doctor that although her father never got what he wanted, he had what he needed. She throws the talisman to the ground, but it\\'s snatched up by Facilier\\'s shadow and the illusion immediately disappears.\\n\\nFacilier cackles and tells her that she should have taken his deal, but using her tongue, Tia takes the talisman back and shatters it on the ground. The Shadow Man is horrified, and frets how he won\\'t be able to pay back his debt. Totem heads come out of the stone heads, asking if he\\'s ready, which he replies that he isn\\'t. Voodoo dolls climb out of the ground, and in terror, he says that he has lots more plans, revealing that he has the prince locked away, to Tiana\\'s surprise. An enormous totem head sucks in Facilier\\'s shadow, and the hysterical witch doctor himself, to sacrifice his soul in exchange for his unpaid debts. Then the totem heads and voodoo dolls disappear, and a gravestone with the Shadow Man\\'s face on it appears.\\n\\nCharlotte angrily knocks on the door of the building which Lawrence is on, demanding that he open up. Finally, she breaks in, but instead of being the handsome Prince Naveen who she expects, fat, old Lawrence is the one who greets her. Horrified, she screams, and so does he, running past her into the night. The real prince, still in the form of a frog, calls her name, and after being squashed with a book, tells her who he is.\\n\\nTiana arrives, just in time to see Lawrence being hauled into the back of a police car. She then sees Charlotte and Naveen sitting on the steps, the latter explaining his and Tiana\\'s predicament. Charlotte expects marriage, to which Naveen reluctantly agrees but puts emphasis on money being given to Tiana for her restaurant, saying that she is his Evangeline. As they are about to kiss, Tiana stops Naveen but he tells her that it is the only way to get her her dream. But she quietly replies that her dream wouldn\\'t be complete, without him in it. Charlotte, seeing their love, agrees to kiss Naveen, without him having to marry her, but as she plants a kiss on him, the bell sounds, signalling midnight has passed. With seemingly no hope of becoming human again, the frogs smile sadly, but are content with being together, whether in frog or human form.\\n\\nLouis comes running, bringing Ray with him, and they stay with him through his last moments. Back at the bayou, his funeral ceremony is carried out, with the firefly lifted by his relatives, in a leaf, and sent floating on the river. As he disappears into the distance, a new star appears, right next to the Evening Star.\\n\\nNaveen and Tiana get married by Mama Odie, and as they kiss they both transform into humans. Surprised, they realise that by getting married, Tiana was now a princess, and by Naveen kissing her they were both changed back. They then get formally married as humans, to the delight of Eudora, and Naveen\\'s parents. As Tiana throws the bouquet, it\\'s caught by Charlotte\\n\\nAt Finner Bros. Realty, Tiana pushes over tins of her hard-earned money, and the brothers are encouraged by a growl from Louis to hand over the key to the restaurant. Tia and Naveen then get to work, and begin to redecorate and clean up the property, until it is beautifully furnished and Louis is shown to be playing the trumpet with a band, on the stage. The restaurant is full, and Charlotte, \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouffe, Naveen\\'s parents and Eudora are all seated. Charlotte then dances with Naveen\\'s younger brother, who\\'s only six and a half but Charlotte says that she\\'s waited this long. Tiana and Naveen then dance and kiss on the roof of the restaurant.', 'No Synopsis', 'In the city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a teenage prodigy, but seems to be unable to use his intellect for anything more than trying to enter illegal, back-alley bot-fights.\\n\\nHis older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) wishes to change Hiro\\'s mind, and tricks his brother into coming to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Tadashi is a student. While there, Hiro is introduced to a number of Tadashi\\'s \\'nerd school\\' friends: Go Go (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred (T.J. Miller), and the different inventions they have constructed.\\n\\nTadashi then shows Hiro his own project: an inflatable \\'nurse\\' robot, named Baymax (Scott Adsit). Thanks to a chip that Tadashi programmed with numerous medical analysis information, Baymax is quite knowledgeable, impressing Hiro. Once he has performed his task, Baymax returns to sleep mode by being told, \"I am satisfied with my care.\"\\n\\nThe three also meet Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), the head professor of the Institute, and after he compliments Hiro on the miniature battle-robot he\\'s made, Hiro wants to enter the Institute.\\n\\nTadashi then encourages his brother to come up with something that will impress Callaghan at the next robotics exhibit coming up. After Tadashi encourages his brother to \\'use that big brain of yours,\\' Hiro then uses the robotic technology in his battle-bot, and crafts them into thousands of micro-bots, controlled by a neural transmitter. Whatever the wearer thinks, the microbots will do.\\n\\nNeedless to say, Hiro\\'s presentation wins over a number of people at the exhibition, even impressing a high-profile technology guru, named Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk). Alistair offers to purchase Hiro\\'s microbot invention on the spot, but Callaghan claims that Krei is not a trustworthy man with technology. Hiro then declines Krei\\'s request, but is excited when Callaghan presents him with a letter of acceptance to the Institute.\\n\\nHiro, Tadashi, and their friends head off to celebrate, but the mood is cut short when a fire erupts within the exhibition hall. With word that Callaghan is still inside, Tadashi rushes into the building to save him. However, as Hiro watches, an explosion rocks the building, blasting him back.\\n\\nAfter Tadashi\\'s funeral, Hiro becomes distant from his friends, still working through his grief. His aunt (and guardian) Cass (Maya Rudolph), tries to encourage Hiro to go to the Institute and take advantage of his acceptance letter, but he seems unwilling to do so.\\n\\nAfter accidentally hurting himself in his room, Hiro is surprised when Baymax appears. Apparently, Tadashi had brought him back to their shared bedroom before he died. Baymax attempts to help Hiro, who is reluctant to accept it. However, the mood is broken when Hiro finds one of his microbots wriggling in a pocket of his jacket. Putting it in a specimen container, Hiro tries to ignore it, but Baymax notes inquires if he can try to determine where the \\'small robot\\' wishes to go.\\n\\nHiro casually affirms this...not realizing that the robot will follow his commands. Chasing him down, Hiro and Baymax find themselves at an old warehouse. Sneaking inside, Hiro is surprised to find a machine churning out similar microbots, with numerous containers filled with them. However, his surprise turns to shock, when a masked man appears, attempting to kill Hiro and Baymax with the miniature robots.\\n\\nHiro first goes to the police station to report what he\\'s found, but the officer taking down his story seems reluctant to believe him. It also doesn\\'t help that Baymax\\'s battery starts to run low. Hiro manages to get him home to be recharged. It is then that Baymax inquires where Tadashi is. Hiro attempts to explain to the robot that his brother is \\'gone.\\' When Hiro explains that the fire was an accident, he then begins to wonder, given what he saw today...what if it wasn\\'t, an accident?\\n\\nDeciding to figure out who has stolen his invention, Hiro decides to upgrade Baymax. After creating a carbon-fiber suit for the robot, Hiro also programs a new chip that includes numerous martial arts moves, inserting it into an additional slot in Baymax\\'s \\'heart\\' drive, right next to Tasashi\\'s chip of Baymax\\'s programming.\\n\\nThe two then return to the warehouse, only to find it empty. However, Hiro notes his microbot has started to move again, and the two follow its movements to the docks off San Fransokyo. However, something pulls the microbot out of the container, and it disappears off into the misty bay. However, moments later, the masked figure appears, using the microbots as a transport means, and carrying a large object with the symbol of a red bird on it.\\n\\nHiro is just about to send Baymax to get the masked man, when they are accosted by Hiro\\'s friends. Baymax\\'s invite for them to help cheer up Hiro got through, but just then, the masked man attacks them. The group pile into Wasabi\\'s car, as the masked man gives chase. In the aftermath, the car ends up driving into the bay, but the group is saved by Baymax, who has shed his armor, and helps the group float to the surface.\\n\\nAfter getting on land, Fred leads the group to his home...which happens to be a large mansion owned by his parents (who are away).\\n\\nWhile recovering, Hiro shows the group the red bird symbol he saw on the piece of machinery to his friends, but none have seen it. The group soon comes to a consensus, that the man may have been behind Tadashi\\'s death, and Fred believes he knows who it is: Alistair Krei. Fred explains that it was Krei who wanted Hiro\\'s microbot technology, and most likely, has gained it at the expense of Tadashi\\'s life.\\n\\nBaymax also surprises Hiro, when he explains that during the fight, he scanned the masked man, and has information on his health and vitals. Hiro wants to identify where their adversary is, but he would need to scan everyone in San Fransokyo to find out.\\n\\nThe group then decides to band together to stop Krei, with Hiro helping to design them each special suits based on their specific abilities.\\n\\nOnce Hiro has done this, he and Baymax fly up above the city, and scan the city from an aerial fan. Baymax\\'s sensors pick up their adversary\\'s health vitals, coming from an island in the bay.\\n\\nThe group flies there, to find a deserted base. One room shows the twisted metal remains of some machine, with the red bird symbol on it. The group then goes into a control room, where video shows that the room was used for testing a teleportation project, called \"Operation: Silent Sparrow.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, their masked adversary appears, and the group attempts to take him down, but are completely unsure what to do. Hiro manages to unmask their foe, but instead of finding Krei...he finds Professor Callaghan.\\n\\nCallaghan explains that in the fire, he managed to use Hiro\\'s microbot technology to shield himself from the explosion. This infuriates Hiro, who demands that Baymax destroy Callaghan. Baymax claims that his programming doesn\\'t allow this, leading to Hiro pulling out the chip Tadashi put in him. The removal of the chip causes Baymax to follow Hiro\\'s orders, and he charges at Callaghan. However, Hiro\\'s friends attempt to stop Baymax, with the robot fighting back at them, before Honey manages to restore Tadashi\\'s chip to his programming.\\n\\nCallaghan has escaped during the fight, and Hiro demands that Baymax find him, only for the robot to explain that his scanners are damaged. Bent on revenge, Hiro blasts away with Baymax back to the garage. He attempts to update Baymax\\'s programming, but Baymax refuses to open the port where his chip information is.\\n\\nIn desperation, Hiro finally breaks down over the death of his brother, with Baymax countering that, \\'Tadashi is here.\\' As Hiro watches, Baymax projects video of Tadashi\\'s numerous attempts to get him running, with the 84th test being a success, and Tadashi claiming that Baymax is \"going to help a whole lot of people.\"\\n\\nHiro\\'s friends eventually return to the garage where he is, and reveal that they have found further footage of the military test. The footage shows Professor Callaghan also at the test area, and reveal his motives behind his actions. During the test, a human test subject was propelled into the portal. However, the portal became unstable, and Krei ordered it shut down. It turns out that the test subject, was Callaghan\\'s daughter, Abigail (Katie Lowes).\\n\\nThe next day, Krei is revealing the opening of a new facility in the heart of San Fransokyo, when Callaghan appears, using the microbots to piece together the last active portal, over Krei\\'s building. Callaghan claims he\\'s going to ruin Krei\\'s life like he ruined his, as the portal comes to life, and starts to tear apart the building, sucking its pieces into the other dimension.\\n\\nIt is then that Hiro and his friends appear, pleading with Callaghan to stop what he\\'s doing, but the former Professor refuses to listen to reason. The group attempts to stop him, but Callaghan uses the microbots to counter their attacks.\\n\\nDuring the fight, Hiro notices that the stray microbots are being sucked up into the portal, and he and the rest of the team work to hack away at their structures, until Callaghan is soon down to a bare minimum.\\n\\nBaymax manages to remove the control mask from him, but once he\\'s done so, notes a faint life signal from within the portal. Even though it is unstable, Hiro and Baymax head into it.\\n\\nWithin the otherworldly atmosphere, they find the test pod, with Abigail inside. Baymax and Hiro then attempt to maneuver her out of the dimension, but a stray piece of debris from Krei\\'s building slams into Baymax, ripping away much of his suit, and rendering his rocket boosters inoperable.\\n\\nBaymax claims that he can get Hiro and Abigail to safety by using his rocket punch. Hiro doesn\\'t want to lose Baymax, but the robot assures the boy, that he\\'ll \"always be with him.\" Tearfully, Hiro utters \"I\\'m satisfied with my care,\" and Baymax launches off his rocket fist, getting Hiro and Callaghan\\'s daughter through the portal, just before it tears itself apart.\\n\\nIn the aftermath, Abigail is taken to a hospital, and Callaghan is arrested for his crimes. In the meantime, local news reports on a band of superheroes that saved the city. However, Hiro and his friends celebrate by having some downtime at his Aunt\\'s place.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, Hiro starts his classes at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Taking residence in the same lab that Tadashi has, Hiro has brought along the rocket fist Baymax wore...only to find wedged in its closed fist, the green microchip card that Tadashi had put into Baymax.\\n\\nHiro manages to rebuild Baymax, and places the chip inside him, embracing his fellow comrade. In the end, we see Hiro, Baymax, and their friends, running through the streets of San Fransokyo, ready to help their city, in any way they can.', 'In the prologue, told through stained glass windows, an old beggar woman arrives at the castle of a French prince. The woman asks for shelter from the cold, and in return, offers the young prince a rose. Repulsed by her appearance, the prince turns her away. The beggar warns him not to judge by appearances, but the Prince ignores her and shuts the door on her. The woman then throws off her disguise, revealing that she is a beautiful enchantress. The Prince tries to apologize, but she has already seen the lack of kindness in his heart. She conjures a powerful curse, transforming him into a hideous beast, his servants into anthropomorphic household items, and the entire castle and all its surroundings into a dark, forbidding place, so that he will learn not to judge by appearances. The curse can only be broken if the Beast learns to love another and receives the other\\'s love in return before the last petal of the enchantress\\'s rose withers and falls; if not, he will be doomed to remain a beast forever. As the years pass, the Beast sits in his castle wallowing in despair, convinced that no one could ever love him.\\n\\nYears later, a beautiful young peasant woman named Belle (Paige O\\'hara) lives in a nearby village with her father, Maurice (Rex Everhart), who is an inventor. Belle is seen as \"odd\" by the other townsfolk due to her preference for reading books (\"Belle\"). She is the object of unwanted attention from the local hunter, Gaston (Richard White), whom she perceives as an egomaniac and \\'positively primeval\\', barbarian-brained, lunkhead. He and his sidekick, LeFou (Jesse Corti), openly mock her father\\'s inventions and her love of books. Belle reveals her feelings of loneliness to her father, who promises her that his next invention, a wood-chopping machine, will be the start of a new life for them both.\\n\\nMaurice rides off to a fair with his invention, but gets lost and loses his horse as night falls. He escapes from some wolves and desperately seeks shelter from a storm. Cold and tired, he stumbles upon a mysterious castle and enters. There, he meets the enchanted household items - Cogsworth (David Ogden Steirs) the mantel clock/majordomo, Lumière the candelabra/maître d\\' (Jerry Orbach), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) the teapot/cook, and her son Chip the tea cup (Bradley Pierce). The Beast (Robby Benson), however, is enraged when he discovers Maurice and is about to throw him out, not caring that the wolves would eat him, when Maurice says he needs a place to stay. The Beast then decides to lock him in a dungeon in the castle tower (against Maurice\\'s wishes).\\n\\nThe next day, Gaston arranges a wedding ceremony right outside of Belle\\'s house and invites the entire town. He invites himself in to propose to her and gives her an image of their life together -- \"A rustic hunting lodge, my little wife massaging my feet, while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs; oh, we\\'ll have six or seven [strapping boys, like me]\". Belle attempts to politely decline when Gaston corners her against her front door and tries to kiss her. As she opens the door to move out of the way, he falls through the door frame and into the mud in front of the entire town. This serves as a hard blow to Gaston\\'s ego. (\"Belle reprise\")\\n\\nBelle, who worries when her father\\'s horse returns home without him, decides to seek out her father. Eventually, she winds up at the Beast\\'s castle. The objects, their hope renewed with the arrival of Belle, show her the way to the dungeon while keeping themselves concealed from her sight. Belle finds Maurice in the tower dungeon, but the Beast catches her. She offers herself in exchange for her father\\'s life, against his wishes, giving her word to remain in the castle forever. The Beast reveals himself to her, and although Belle is clearly terrified, she bravely refuses to back down from her offer. The Beast agrees and releases Maurice, who is taken back to the village in an walking coach before they can say goodbye. Moved by Belle\\'s sadness, the Beast decides to give Belle a room in the castle instead of keeping her in the dungeon. The Beast gives Belle permission to go anywhere in the castle except the West Wing, refusing to explain why. He shows Belle her room and tells her that they must meet for dinner (at Lumiere\\'s suggestion).\\n\\nBack in the village, the citizens attempt to cheer up Gaston in the local tavern after Belle\\'s rejection by reminding him how in awe they are of him (Gaston\"). Maurice bursts in and asks for help to rescue Belle from \"a beast\", but no one believes him. When one of the villagers calls him crazy, Gaston thinks of a plan to get Belle to marry him. Maurice goes off to search for Belle alone, unaware of Gaston\\'s plan. Gaston and the others arrive at the house shortly after Maurice leaves. Finding the house empty, Gaston orders LeFou to wait by the porch until Belle and Maurice return.\\n\\nBelle meets the enchanted objects and the Wardrobe (Joanne Worrley) and Fifi the Featherduster (Kath Soucie) who cheer her up, but she refuses to have dinner with the Beast. Enraged, he tells the servants that if Belle does not eat with him, she will have to starve, then shuts himself away in the West Wing. He sees Belle through the magic mirror, who angrily cries that she will have nothing to do with the Beast. Melancholy, he watches one more petal fall from the rose. Ignoring the Beast\\'s orders, Lumiere, along with the other servants, welcomes Belle warmly and entertains her with an elaborate dinner and a show (\"Be Our Guest\"). After dinner, Belle asks the servants for a tour of the castle. Lumiere and Cogsworth happily oblige, but Belle manages to sneak away from them and penetrate into the forbidden West Wing, where she discovers an extremely disarrayed and desolate room, a slashed portrait of a handsome man with strangely familiar blue eyes, and the enchanted rose. The Beast finds her there and frightens her with a terrifying display of temper. Belle flees the castle, disregarding her promise to the Beast, and, in the dark forest, is attacked by wolves. The Beast appears and fights off the vicious creatures, but is wounded during the fight and weakly collapses; a grateful Belle returns to the castle and, while nursing the Beast\\'s wounds, thanks him for saving her life. Over some time, the two start to become friends. The Beast even gives Belle \"ownership\" of his immense library. (\"Something There\") The household items are excited and optimistic that Belle may fall in love with the Beast and cause them to become human again. The relationship reaches its climax with an elegant dinner and ballroom dance. (\"Beauty and the Beast\")\\n\\nAfter the romantic evening, The Beast notices that Belle seems melancholy. She tells him that she wishes to see Maurice again, just for a moment. The Beast takes her to the West Wing and gives her the magic mirror, explaining that it will allow her to see anything she might desire to see. Belle asks if she can see her father and the magic mirror reveals that Maurice is lost and sick in the forest. The Beast, having fallen in love with Belle, releases her to rescue her father and also gives her the mirror so that she may look back and remember him. Belle hurries off, finds Maurice and takes him back to the village, where a mob gathers to take him to the asylum. Gaston offers to have Maurice spared if Belle agrees to marry him but she still refuses. Belle uses the magic mirror to show the Beast to the villagers, who become frightened at his hideous visage. Belle assures them that the Beast is kind and gentle, and that he\\'s her friend. Out of jealousy and anger, Gaston tells the mob that Belle is as crazy as her father. Belle disagrees and calls him the real beast for wanting to kill him. She tells him off that she sees him as nothing more than a sexist, narcissistic, rude, obnoxious and selfish jerk. Insulted, Gaston rallies the villagers to storm the castle and \"kill the beast,\" (\"Mob song\") convincing them that he is dangerous to the entire town. To prevent Belle and Maurice from warning the Beast, Gaston has his men lock them in the cellar of their home.\\n\\nWith the help of Chip the teacup, who has stowed away in Belle\\'s satchel, Belle and Maurice escape from the cellar using the invention and rush back to the castle. The villagers force open the door, but Cogsworth and Lumiere leads the servants in defense of the castle. Gaston deserts the battle to search for the Beast. The servants eventually manage to drive the villagers out of the castle.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gaston finds the Beast alone in the West Wing and attacks him, throwing both of them outside on the balcony and rooftops. The Beast does not defend himself because he has given up hope of being able to see Belle again. As soon as he sees Belle arriving at the castle, calling out for him, the Beast gains the will to fight Gaston. A heated battle ensues between the two, culminating when the Beast grabs Gaston by the neck and threatens to throw him off the roof. Gaston begs for his life, and the Beast relents, softened by his love for Belle. He tells Gaston to leave and never come back, and then throws him aside. When the Beast climbs back up to the balcony where Belle is waiting for him, Gaston stabs him in the back, then loses his footing and falls into the deep chasm far below, signaling his death.\\n\\nBelle tries to reassure the badly wounded Beast that everything will be fine, but he knows that his wound is fatal. The Beast tells her that he was happy to see her one last time, and dies succumbing to his injury. Belle, in tears, whispers that she loves him, just before the last petal falls from the rose. The spell is broken. The Beast, brought back to life, is reverted to his human form, unrecognizable until Belle looks into his blue eyes. The castle becomes beautiful again and the enchanted objects turn back into humans. The last scene shows Belle and the prince dancing in the ballroom while her father and the servants watch and they live happily ever after.

Woody and the other toys mount a successful rescue operation, but while they are busy, a friend of Andy\\'s mother arrives and buys Bo Peep and her lamp; despite Woody\\'s efforts to prevent the sale, Bo reassures him that it is part of being a toy to be taken away.\\n\\nTwo years after Andy donated his toys to Bonnie, Woody and the other toys are content in their new life. Worried that Bonnie will feel overwhelmed at her kindergarten orientation, Woody - who Bonnie has been neglecting - sneaks into her backpack, and his fears come to light. But after a male classmate bullies Bonnie, Woody covertly places a spork and other items from a trash can on Bonnie\\'s table during arts and crafts, and she turns them into a handmade toy-spork she names \"Forky\". After Bonnie places Forky in her backpack, he comes to life, which scares Woody.\\n\\nWoody introduces him to the rest of Bonnie\\'s toys, Forky experiences an existential crisis, believing he was made to be trash and not a toy, and the other toys prevent him from throwing himself away. On a road trip with Bonnie\\'s family and her toys, Forky - still believing himself to be trash - jumps out of the window, prompting Woody to go after him. Woody convinces Forky of the joys of being a toy, and they journey to the RV park in a nearby town where Bonnie and her parents will be staying.\\n\\nReaching the town, Woody spots Bo\\'s lamp at an antique store. Searching for Bo inside, he and Forky encounter a doll named Gabby Gabby and her sycophant ventriloquist puppets, the Bensons. Gabby Gabby offers to take them to Bo, but soon reveals her true colors and plan: To obtain Woody\\'s voice box since her own is broken and no child will purchase her. Woody and Forky try to escape, but Forky is captured by the Bensons. By the time Woody escapes the shop, he realizes that he has left Forky behind. Woody reunites with Bo, who has become a nomad adventurer helping lost toys find owners. With Bo\\'s companion, a diminutive toy cop named Giggle McDimples, they take a route through a nearby carnival to rescue Forky from the antique store.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Buzz searches for Woody on his own, seeking guidance in the button-induced phrases from his own voice box. Buzz finds himself as a prize in a carnival booth and escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny. Buzz finds Woody and Bo, and they recruit Ducky and Bunny to help rescue Forky, promising they will become Bonnie\\'s toys, along with Bo\\'s old friend from the antique store, Duke Caboom, a Canadian stuntman toy. At the antique store, the toys\\' plan to rescue Forky fails. Woody, the only toy still determined to save Forky, has a falling out with the other toys and indirectly insults Bo. As Bo, Duke, Giggle, Ducky, and Bunny return to the carnival, Woody gives up his voice box to Gabby Gabby in exchange for Forky. Gabby Gabby is desperate to be adopted by Margaret (the store owner)\\'s granddaughter, Harmony, but Harmony is not interested in Gabby Gabby and rejects her, leaving her disappointed, and offers Woody his voice box back, but Woody insists she keeps it. Buzz returns to Bonnie\\'s RV and cries out to retrieve Bonnie\\'s backpack, which she left at the antique store. Woody comforts Gabby Gabby and Bo, and her gang return after a change of heart.\\n\\nAfter Bonnie returns for her backpack, the toys follow her and her parents. Buzz and Forky make it back to Bonnie through Duke\\'s motorcycle skills, who is delighted to have Forky back. Taking Woody\\'s advice, Gabby Gabby sees a lost little girl crying, giving her comfort, and is finally found by her parents. Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke Caboom say goodbye to Woody and leave.\\n\\nAs Woody and Bo say goodbye, Woody becomes hesitant to return with Bonnie. With some encouragement from Buzz, Woody decides to stay with Bo and help lost toys find owners. Buzz and the gang give Woody a goodbye hug, and the two groups go their separate ways. The RV\\'s engine starts, and the toys head into Bonnie\\'s RV while her parents start the engine and head home. Rex asks if Woody will be a lost toy, and Buzz says that he will never be one. Buzz and Woody share one last message to each other from afar, \"To infinity...and beyond.\" Woody and Bo Peep spend their night living together by looking at the nice carnival view and the night sky.\\n\\nAfter Woody and Bo travel with the carnival in the mid-credits scenes, one year has passed, and Bonnie entered first grade. At a newly built pier, Ducky and Bunny do one more version of their \"plush rush\" and spread laser eyes and superpowers, which Duke Caboom asks if they really can. At Bonnie\\'s room, mirroring the scene where Woody introduces Forky, Jessie brings home a new friend Bonnie created: Karen Beverly, a decorated plastic knife. Instantly smitten, Forky offers to shepherd her in her journey through life as a toy instead of trash. When her first question is \"How am I alive?\" he is stumped, and all he could say was \"I don\\'t know\".\\n\\nIn the post-credits scene: Duke Caboom successfully jumps onto the \\'I\\' of the Pixar logo, poses, and gives the winter Combat Carl a long-awaited high five, ending the movie.', \"The film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers Techno music.\\n\\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the Techno string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\\n\\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\\n\\nThe balloon ends up in the land of Classical Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small flute named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the Country Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a Smooth Jazz Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\\n\\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the Funk Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both Pop and Funk, and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original Pop Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\\n\\nAfter the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken.

Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending music, and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb's anguish.\\n\\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of sound making, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored.

But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack\\'s life and he\\'s tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O\\'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn\\'t notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown\\'s evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)\\n\\nAfter pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who\\'s replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they\\'re sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.\\n\\nBack in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don\\'t seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including \"Sandy Claws\" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they\\'re taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs. The evil scientist must whip up some reindeer, Halloweentown\\'s top trick-or-treaters are to kidnap Sandy Claws, and Sally\\'s task is to make Jack a red Santa suit. She tries to tell him that co-opting Christmas is a terrible idea, but he\\'s too wrapped up in his enthusiasm to listen.\\n\\nThe three trick-or-treaters return triumphantly with the Easter Bunny; Jack sends them back and eventually they bring him Sandy Claws (who surprises Jack by having hands rather than claws). Jack directs the trick-or-treaters to take Sandy Claws away and make him comfortable, but they give him to Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) instead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sally has produced a red suit (without a hat, so Jack steals Sandy\\'s) and the evil scientist\\'s skeletal reindeer are hitched to a sleigh full of creepy toys. Sally tries to sabotage his Christmas Eve delivery by adding fog juice to the town well, and it almost works. But the spectral dog Zero, who happens to have a glowing nose, comes to the rescue. Sally deduces that only Sandy Claws will be able to help Jack now, and sneaks into Oogie Boogie\\'s lair in an effort to free him.\\n\\nJack sets off in his sleigh, but he doesn\\'t really get Christmas -- his idea of a keen gift for a small child is a shrunken head or a toy duck with sharp teeth that chases its owner -- so he spreads terror and mayhem at every house he visits. He ends up being blown up out of the sky by the terrified populace. Realizing both his mistake and his desire to be the best pumpkin king he can be, he goes back to Halloweentown to find Sandy Claws and set Christmas right.\\n\\nHe surprises Oogie Boogie, frees Sally and Sandy Claws, and unravels Oogie Boogie in a decisive final showdown. Santa Claus scolds Jack about trying to take over a holiday that isn\\'t his, and then sets about magically saving Christmas. Jack and Sally return to town just as Santa Claus flies over and offers the Halloweentownsfolk a bit of Christmas magic: their first snowfall. Jack and Sally share a tender moment in the cemetery, realizing they were always meant to be together.', 'Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) longs to be as beloved as his games perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of Jack McBrayer). Problem is, nobody loves a Bad Guy. But they do love heroes so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (voice of Jane Lynch), Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan: win a medal, but soon wrecks everything and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph\\'s only hope is Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman), a young troublemaking glitch from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero before it\\'s Game Over for the entire arcade?\\n\\nThe film takes place in Litwik\\'s Arcade, and concerned the character of Wreck-it-Ralph, the bad guy in the Fix-It-Felix Jr video game.\\n\\nWhen we are introduced to Ralph, he is attending \\'Bad-anon,\\' a support group for the video game bad guys that inhabit the arcade\\'s games. Ralph explains that after 30 years of doing the same thing and getting no respect for his job, he feels that he doesn\\'t want to be the bad guy anymore. The other members claim that he can\\'t mess with the program of his game, and soon finish the meeting, leaving Ralph still dejected.\\n\\nGoing through \\'Game Central Station\\' (a power strip with surge protectors that has all the arcade\\'s game plugged into it), Ralph returns to his game, only to see the inhabitants of the Niceland apartments throwing a party (even Pac-Man is there!). Ralph is upset that he wasn\\'t invited, and attempts to get in. However, upon seeing a special cake that was made with all the Nicelanders and Felix on top and Ralph in a pit on the bottom, he gets upset. When one of the Nicelanders claims that he\\'s just the bad guy who wrecks things,\\' Ralph destroys the cake in a fit of rage and angrily leaves, intending to somehow get a medal of his own, and prove he can be a hero.\\n\\nGoing off to a bar-game called Tapper\\'s, Ralph is unsure what to do, when he encounters a soldier from a new first-person shooter named \"Hero\\'s Duty.\" The soldier is a nervous wreck from hunting bugs, but when Ralph hears there\\'s a medal at the end of the game, he eagerly takes up the soldier\\'s armor, and heads off through \\'Game Central Station,\\' to board the transport to \"Hero\\'s Duty.\" On his way there Q*Bert, a homeless character whose game has been unplugged is at the station and he tell him where he is going, then is off.\\n\\nRalph eagerly gets ready for a new round of the game, whose squadron is being led by Sgt Calhoun (Jane Lynch). However, once the game starts, Ralph realizes he\\'s in way over his head, when the group is bombarded by giant mechanical \\'Cy-bugs,\\' that take on the properties of whatever they consume. Ralph accidentally gets the first-person shooter (aka a kid playing the game inside the arcade) killed, and the game ends. As it does, a giant beam of light shoots out of the top of a nearby tower, attracting the Cy-bugs, and incinerating them as they are drawn into its light.\\n\\nAs the game begins to reset for the next player, Ralph learns that the medal he wants is at the top of that tower. Removing his armor, he climbs the tower, and finds himself in a room full of Cy-bug eggs. Making his way through them all, he finds the medal (with the name \\'Hero\\' on it) floating in the center of the room. Reaching it and taking it, a group of holographic soldiers appear, and salute Ralph on a job well done.\\n\\nRalph gets a bit too excited, and accidentally steps on an egg, releasing a Cy-bug hatchling. It begins to attack Ralph, who attempts to get away in an escape pod. However, the pod takes off with the Cy-bug inside it. Sgt Calhoun and the others see it take off, and it escapes into the portal to \\'Game Central Station.\\' It bounces around the station, before sending Ralph into a nearby racing game called \\'Sugar Rush.\\' Crash-landing, the ejector seat sends Ralph in one direction, and the Cy-bug in another, sending it into a deep pit.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Fix-It-Felix, Jr, the denizens of the game suddenly realize that Ralph is missing when a player attempts to play a game. The players panic, causing the player to assume something is wrong with the game when \\'the wrecking guy\\' doesn\\'t show up. The arcade\\'s owner, Mr Litwik, is informed, and an \\'out of order\\' sign is placed over the game. The game\\'s denizens are unsure where Ralph may have gone, but get a surprise when Q*Bert shows up to say that Ralph was seen entering the game \\'Hero\\'s Duty.\\'\\n\\nWith the possibility that without Ralph, the game\\'s plug will be pulled and their time will end, Felix heads into \\'Hero\\'s Duty\\' to find Ralph. After almost being killed by Sgt Calhoun and her soldiers, Felix explains he is looking for Ralph, and also slowly falls in love with the Sergeant\\'s \\'hi-definition\\' looks. They then leave the game, and after finding out which way the escape pod went, set off into \\'Sugar Rush\\'. Calhoun is greatly concerned, because Cy-bugs can multiply when plenty of food is available, i.e. the candies and sweets of \\'Sugar Rush\\', and the possibility of the game being overrun by them is highly possible.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ralph finds his medal hanging from the top of a candy-cane tree, along with a little girl named Vanellope Von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman). Vanellope ends up taking the medal before Ralph can get to it, and he then attempts to track her down.\\n\\nVanellope ends up using the medal in place of a game coin for a major race to decide which of the top 9 racers (along with their ruler, King Candy (Alan Tudyk)) will get to be the chosen racers for the next day\\'s play of the arcade (this is how the game randomly selects new racers for each day). However, when her entry is seen on the board, King Candy orders her to be caught, but this is interrupted when Ralph comes barreling through the starting line, attempting to get Vanellope himself, and destroying the area.\\n\\nRalph is then captured and brought before King Candy. The King is at first shocked that Ralph appears to be \\'game-jumping,\\' but Ralph claims that all he wants is his medal back. However, the King informs him that since it\\'s now been entered into the game\\'s programming, the only way he can get it back is if he wins the race.\\n\\nRalph then leaves the King\\'s castle still upset, but upon seeing several of the racers nearby, he figures maybe he can explain to them to win the race and get his medal for him. However, his thoughts are sidelined when the racers come across Vanellope, who has finished a small pedal-cart she intends to use in the race. As Ralph watches, the other kids say she can\\'t enter because she\\'s a glitch, and then wreck her cart. Ralph scares them off, and Vanellope decides to make a deal with Ralph: if he helps her get a new cart for the race, she\\'ll win back his medal for him. Ralph is at first unsure of the alliance, but agrees to it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Felix and Calhoun have discovered the crashed escape pod, but no sign of Ralph or the Cy-bug. Calhoun attempts to use a detector for finding the bug, but it can\\'t focus because of the sugar particles interfering with the detector. As they continue on their journey, the end up in a pit of Nes-quik sand, and Felix is able to get them out by grabbing onto some Laffy-Taffy hanging from the trees.\\n\\nAfter they get out, Felix makes mention that some would consider Ralph going outside of his game to be \\'turbo.\\' When Calhoun seems confused at this term, Felix explains where it came from. Many years ago, there was a racing game in the arcade called \"Turbo-Tastic,\" whose main racer loved to win, and grew egotistical about it. When the arcade got a new racing game called \"Roadblasters,\" Turbo abandoned his game, and entered into \"Roadblasters,\" wrecking it. Because of this, both games were unplugged, and presumably, Turbo died when he was unable to return to his game.\\n\\nBack in the world of \"Sugar Rush,\" Ralph and Vanellope break into a cart-baking factory, and Ralph helps Vanellope as best as he can. However, his attempts to help make the car look like a bakery-fueld mess, but Vanellope loves it anyway, and has Ralph sign his name on the side in icing. However, their intrusion is soon found out, and King Candy and his police force soon arrive.\\n\\nRalph tells Vanellope to start driving, only for her to tell him that she doesn\\'t know HOW to drive a cart! Ralph then uses his giant hands to help propel them away from the pursuing King and his police force, losing them when Vanellope directs him to a secret entrance near Diet Cola mountain.\\n\\nInside, Ralph finds a giant pit over which Mentos stalactites hang overhead. When one drops into the soda, it causes a heated geyser to erupt.\\n\\nNearby, Ralph also finds where Vanellope lives, having taken up refuge inside the mountain because no one likes her, or will give her a chance to prove she can race. Seeing how she just wants a chance to prove herself like he does, Ralph helps her learn how to race her vehicle.\\n\\nAs they prepare to take off for the big race, Vanellope rushes back into the mountain to get something. It is then that King Candy shows up, and offers Ralph back his \\'Hero\\' medal. The King then explains to Ralph that he is giving the medal to him, if he\\'ll prevent Vanellope from racing. Ralph claims he won\\'t, when the King tells him that it is essential to saving her life.\\n\\nAs Vanellope is a glitch, she has trouble being a stable racer, and may end up popping up all over the game. If she is chosen to race, and the players don\\'t like her, the plug could be pulled on Sugar Rush. However, because Vanellope is a glitch, she won\\'t be able to escape into Game Central Station, and die within the game.\\n\\nThe King leaves, and Vanellope returns, presenting Ralph with a Heart-shaped cookie medal, calling him both a snotbrain, and her hero for helping her. However, Ralph then attempts to get her to reconsider the race, when she sees he\\'s got his \\'Hero\\' medal back. Ralph then explains what the King told him, but she says she doesn\\'t care and wants to race! Claiming he\\'s saving her life, Ralph hangs Vanellope from a nearby tree, and breaks her cart. Heart-broken that he has ruined her chance, she claims he \\'really is a bad guy,\\' and rushes back to her hide-out.\\n\\nOver at the King\\'s castle, Felix has parted ways with Calhoun who is still looking for the Cy-bug, and arrives at the castle door. Felix meets the King\\'s assistant, a little sourball. Realizing that Felix is from Ralph\\'s game, he sends him to the king\\'s Fungeon.\\n\\nNow that he\\'s got his medal back, Ralph returns to his game, but finds the Niceland apartments are empty, except for one lone tenant, who explains everyone else headed to Game Central Station for safe haven. Ralph claims he got a medal that proves he\\'s a hero, but in the wake of the game\\'s plug being pulled at dawn if it doesn\\'t function properly, the need to prove himself seems nil. Upset that he seems to have made a mess of things for his game as well as for Vanellope, he flings his \\'Hero\\' medal at the case of the arcade game, causing the out-of-order sign to fall slightly. As it does so, he can see the gaming console for \\'Sugar Rush,\\' and finds a strange sight: even though she is considered a glitch, Vanellope is on the advertising graphics for the game on its gaming console!\\n\\nRalph then returns to \\'Sugar Rush\\' and heads for diet cola mountain, finding the King\\'s sourball cleaning up the remnants of Vanellope\\'s cart. Ralph then gets the little sourball to tell that King Candy changed around Vanellope\\'s code, but as to why he did this, the sourball has no clue. He also tells Ralph that both Felix and Vanellope are being held in the King\\'s Fungeon, and Ralph sets out there along with the garbage can containing the broken pieces of Vanellope\\'s kart.\\n\\nRalph rescues Felix first, and the two reconcile, with Felix finally understanding why Ralph seemed to be acting so strange when he burst in on the party the other day.\\n\\nUsing Felix\\'s magical hammer, they repair Vanellope\\'s cart, and manage to free her, with Ralph first admitting what a moron he was.\\n\\nAs the race gets underway, Vanellope quickly takes off, leaving Felix and Ralph at the starting line. However, Calhoun also arrives, alerting them that the Cy-bug has eaten plenty under the grounds of Sugar Rush, and has multiplied into a giant army. As if on cue, they burst up around the stadium. Calhoun attempts to kill them off, but there are just too many. She quickly yells for those nearby to head towards the portal to Game Central Station. With the game too overrun with the creatures, they\\'ll need to kill the game to end them. Realizing that it\\'ll mean the end for Vanellope, Ralph stays by the finish line as long as he can, figuring if Vanellope can at least cross the finish line, she\\'ll be able to escape.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the race continues onward, and Vanellope finally catches up to King Candy. However, as the two battle car-to-car, the King begins to glitch, and we see that he is Turbo in disguise! It soon becomes apparent that he took over \\'Sugar Rush\\', locking up the memories of the other racers, thus making her a glitch!\\n\\nLuckily, Vanellope manages to get free, and focuses her glitching powers to break free of the Turbo\\'s grasp, and speed into 1st position. As he attempts to catch up to her, a Cy-bug emerges in front of his car, and eats him up.\\n\\nAs she nears the finish line, Vanellope\\'s car is thrown off-track by another horde of Cy-bugs, and she is scooped up by Ralph, who takes her towards the portal to Game Central Station as the horde devours the finish line. Almost everyone else is able to get through but Vanellope. Ralph tries as hard as he can to take her, but it\\'s no use.\\n\\nAs Calhoun continues to blast away as many Cy-bugs as she can, she explains the only way they would be able to stop the horde, is if they had a beam of light to blast them away, like in \"Hero\\'s Duty.\" Ralph suddenly flashes back to Diet Cola Mountain, and the group of Mentos stalactites, and formulates a plan!\\n\\nGrabbing a hoverboard from Calhoun, he flies towards the mountain. Using his fists, he attempts to dislodge the Mentos at the top, to create a new beam of killing light. However, his plans are interrupted when a Cy-bug appears, with the colors and head of King Candy and Turbo. The newly-powered-up tyrant knocks Ralph around a bit, saying he is the most powerful virus in the arcade and will attempt to take over all the other games for revenge, Ralph battles Turbo, but Turbo dislikes being stopped and quickly overpowers Ralph, flying him above the mountain and sarcastically forcing him to watch Cy-Bugs close in on Vanellope. Ralph finds a way to stop Turbo\\'s revenge, manages to break free from Cy-bug Turbo, aiming towards the Mentos. As he hits them, and they fall towards the cola pit deep within the mountain.\\n\\nLuckily, before he hits the bubbling pit, Vanellope gets back in her cart, and focusing her glitching power, manages to save Ralph before the major eruption.\\n\\nThe eruption shines a bright light, which in turn draws most the Cy-Bugs, to their destruction. Turbo being more powerful then the others is able to resist for a short time but his Cy-Bug programming overwhelms him and he flies into the lava as well, killing him. Because video game characters who die outside their own game are unable to regenerate ever, this means that the Cy-Bugs gets destroyed and Turbo gets destroyed permanently to his death, as the eruption stops Turbo\\'s revenge, because which causes King Candy\\'s code to be destroyed forever.\\n\\nAfter this, Vanellope manages to cross the finish line, and due to Turbo\\'s brainwash, the memories of the other players are reprogramed, and Vanellope is returned to being the Princess of Sugar Rush and a true character again. However, she claims that she doesn\\'t really want to be a Princess, and feels that a government run by a President would be more her style. Turbo has disappeared forever (Sour Bill, Wynchel and Duncan, the Sugar Rush Racers and the Citizens, never heard of him again).\\n\\nIn the aftermath, Felix and Calhoun are wed (even though their games will keep them apart by day in the arcade). Vanellope is now a regular racer in \\'Sugar Rush,\\' though she still uses the cart that Ralph helped her build, and her glitching power makes her a big hit with the players.\\n\\nAs for Ralph, the Nicelanders finally acknowledge and appreciate him. Ralph also claims that even though he still gets pitched off the top of the apartment building in his game, he loves the view through the glass of the video game box, and seeing his friend Vanellope doing what she loves, he feels great.', 'Andy Davis (voice: John Morris) is 17 years old, and is heading off to college in a few days. The fact that Andy has grown from a young boy to a teenager about to leave home has not been lost on his toys.\\n\\nSeveral of them hold out hope that Andy will play with them at least once before he leaves, but those hopes are soon dashed. As the toys take stock of how many are left, and those that they have lost over the years, their attention is drawn to the last of the little green Army Men: Sarge (voice: R. Lee Ermey) and two paratroopers. Fearful of being thrown away, they leap out the window into the world beyond, their parachutes taking them who knows where.\\n\\nThis idea soon fills the heads of the remaining toys: Woody (voice: Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voice: Tim Allen), Jessie (voice: Joan Cusack), Bullseye (voice: Frank Welker), Mr. Potato Head (voice: Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head (voice: Estelle Harris), three alien squeak toys from Pizza Planet, Slinky Dog (voice: Blake Clark), Rex (voice: Wallace Shawn), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (voice: John Ratzenberger).\\n\\nSeveral are of the persuasion that Sarge is right, and they\\'ll be tossed out soon, but Woody believes that Andy wouldn\\'t do that. He figures Andy will store them in the attic...maybe one day to be played with again when Andy has kids of his own.\\n\\nThe toys\\' \"staff meeting\" is cut short when Andy returns to his room with his mom (voice: Laurie Metcalf) in tow. With only a few days left until he leaves, Andy has not cleaned up his room. Andy\\'s mom is having Andy\\'s sister Molly (voice: Bea Miller) clean her room as well, and tells the two to throw out what they don\\'t want, store extra items in the attic, or donate items to Sunnyside Daycare. From Andy\\'s room, the toys watch as Molly throws her Barbie doll (voice: Jodi Benson) in the donations box, along with some other toys.\\n\\nAndy finally takes out a black trash bag and begins to put his old toys into it. When he gets to Woody and Buzz, he hesitates before putting Woody in a box marked \\'College\\' and tossing Buzz in the black trash bag. Inside, the toys think they are going to be thrown away, and Woody watches as Andy leaves the room. His panic turns to relief as he sees Andy open the attic door. However, before Andy can go up, he helps Molly move the donations box downstairs. The lapse causes the attic door to close, and Andy\\'s Mom soon after finds the trash bag with the toys. Thinking Andy left trash lying around, she takes it with another bag to the curb.\\n\\nWoody looks down the street in horror as the garbage truck slowly makes its way to the curb. Woody jumps out the window and slides down a pipe to the front lawn...only to see the trash bags thrown into the garbage truck and crushed! Shortly thereafter, Woody notices a recycling bin walking towards the garage. Following it, he is relieved to see that his friends escaped. However, they are now all convinced that Andy meant to throw them away.\\n\\nWoody tries to explain what really happened, but most of them just feel that he is in denial. Jessie soon notices the box of donations to Sunnyside Daycare, and proposes that they all go there. Everyone eagerly jumps in, except for Woody, who demands that they all return to Andy\\'s room right away. Before he can say anymore, the trunk to the family mini-van closes, and Andy\\'s mom takes the box to Sunnyside.\\n\\nAt Sunnyside, Andy\\'s mom brings the toys in to the Butterfly Room. Looking through the handle-hole in the box, the toys are excited to see a group of children happily playing with the toys in the room.\\n\\nAfter the recess bell sounds and the kids leave the room, the toys eagerly escape from the box, only to meet a very friendly group of toys who are excited to see them. The group is soon joined by a strawberry-scented bear named Lotso (voice: Ned Beatty), who soon calls his associate Ken (voice: Michael Keaton) to escort the group around, showing them what Sunnyside has to offer. During the tour Ken becomes smitten with Barbie...who finds herself drawn to him as well.\\n\\nLotso explains that the toys are taken care of, and that due to a never-ending supply of kids coming and going, the toys will never be without someone to play with them. Andy\\'s toys eagerly accompany Lotso over to the Caterpillar Room, where he then leaves them to experience their first playtime at Sunnyside. However, Ken and Barbie appear to have gotten along quite well, and Barbie eagerly goes back with Ken and Lotso to the Butterfly Room.\\n\\nWoody explains that while Sunnyside does seem great, he strongly believes they should go back to Andy. Woody asks Buzz to come back, but Buzz refuses, saying they should stick together. Realizing that the others won\\'t accompany him, Woody sneaks out of Sunnyside, but not before accidentally losing his hat. In the process, a little girl named Bonnie (voice: Emily Ricks Hahn) finds him and takes him home with her.\\n\\nBack in the Caterpillar Room, recess ends, and the toys get their first playtime...only to find the room filled with noisy screaming toddlers, each of them rambunctious and not as \\'delicate\\' as Andy was. They are thrown around, smashed about and covered with poster paint by the toddlers. Once the daycare closes, the toys feel there has been some mistake and that they should be in the Butterfly Room instead. Buzz manages to get out of the room, intending to talk to Lotso. However, once outside, his attention is drawn to Ken and several other toys sneaking inside a vending machine.\\n\\nBuzz follows them, but is caught by a sleepy-eyed doll named Big Baby. Ken and the others take Buzz to the daycare\\'s library and tie him up. Suddenly, Lotso comes across the other toys, and demands that they let Buzz go. Buzz thanks Lotso for helping him out, and makes his request for himself and the other toys to be transferred. Lotso admires Buzz\\'s initiative, but is only willing to consider to have him join the Butterfly Room inhabitants. When Buzz refuses, Lotso orders Buzz held down and procures a Buzz Lightyear instruction manual from the library. Using it, the group of toys sets Buzz to \"demo\" mode &mdash; he\\'s once again the deluded space ranger we met early in the Toy Story (1995)\\n\\nLotso, his compatriots, and demo-Buzz return to the Caterpillar Room, where Buzz subdues his friends and places them in prison-like storage cages. Lotso explains how the daycare is run: all newcomers start in the Caterpillar Room with the ill-behaved toddlers. If they survive, they move up to the Butterfly Room where they\\'ll be treated better.\\n\\nTo set an example about what happens to troublemakers, Lotso has Big Baby take Mr. Potato Head out to the playground and stuff him in \"the Box\" (a sandbox). Also as a warning, Lotso produces Woody\\'s hat, although he doesn\\'t explain what happened to the toys\\' friend. Barbie realizes that Ken lied to her and as she refuses to be part of Lotso\\'s regime, she\\'s imprisoned as well.\\n\\nDuring the toys\\' day at Sunnyside, Woody has been in Bonnie\\'s house, taking part in her imaginative fun and games. Woody grows excited to be part of a real playtime again, but longs to get back to Andy.\\n\\nOnce the household is asleep, Bonnie\\'s toys help Woody access the family computer. Woody is relieved to find that Andy\\'s house is just around the corner. He thanks the toys and tells them that if Bonnie ever outgrows them, they should go to Sunnyside. However, the name causes the toys to look on in fear. The toys explain that Lotso is responsible, and one of Bonnie\\'s toys named Chuckles (voice: Bud Luckey) begins to tell a story.\\n\\nLotso, Chuckles, and Big Baby were once owned by a little girl named Daisy. Of the three, she loved Lotso the most. However, one day at a rest stop, the three toys were accidentally left behind. The three eventually made it back to Daisy\\'s house. Lotso and Chuckles managed to look in her window, only to see that Lotso had been replaced. Lotso, resentful of being left behind, declared they had all been replaced (even though there was only proof that he had been replaced). Big Baby still wanted to go back, but Lotso yelled \"She doesn\\'t love you no more,\" and tore off a necklace around Baby\\'s neck: a plastic heart that said \"I belong to Daisy.\" Secretly, Chuckles kept it.\\n\\nThe three toys went from place to place until they found Sunnyside. Lotso took over and set up the system in which most new toys would be subjected to the rough handling of the toddlers in the Caterpillar Room and would not survive. Chuckles explains that he eventually was broken at Sunnyside, and Bonnie took him in and repaired him. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Woody decides to return to Sunnyside and rescue them.\\n\\nThe next day, Woody sneaks into the daycare and moves around the building above the ceiling tiles. Finding his way into a hidden area of the Caterpillar Room, he chances upon a Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone (voice: Teddy Newton). The telephone tells Woody that he should have stayed gone, and that there\\'s no way that he and his friends can get out. Woody thanks him for the concern, but says they have to try. The Chatter Telephone explains what Woody and his friends will be up against: Lotso\\'s minions manning search lights on the playground, trucks patrolling the halls and the playground, an 8-foot-high cinderblock wall, and a cymbal-clanging monkey (voice: Frank Welker again) that monitors the security cameras in the building. The telephone says the only other way out is through a garbage chute across the playground.\\n\\nOnce the toddlers have gone to recess, Woody joins his friends, who tell him that Buzz was reset to demo mode, and now they want to get back to Andy. Woody sets his plan in motion. Later that evening, the group springs into action: Mr. Potato Head creates a scene to get put in the box again, this time as a way to get outside and report for the group. Barbie pleads with Ken that she can\\'t take being imprisoned, and Ken lets her out. He takes her back to his dream house, where Barbie subdues him, and using one of his outfits as a disguise, infiltrates the daycare library to find the instruction manual for Buzz. Woody and Slinky Dog infiltrate the main security room and take down the cymbal-clanging monkey. Rex and Hamm start a fight to distract Buzz, allowing Jessie to escape. Then they trap Buzz under a plastic tub.\\n\\nThe toys regroup and set about trying to get Buzz back to normal. However, a mistake in resetting Buzz sets him to Spanish mode. With little time left, the group decides to worry about fixing him later, and they set out for the garbage chute.\\n\\nThe gang gets to the end of the chute before plummeting into the dumpster...only to find Lotso, Ken, and his associates waiting (along with the chatter telephone, now broken by the bad toys). Lotso offers the toys a choice: either end up in the dumpster, or return to the daycare. Jessie and Barbie both decry what Lotso has done to the daycare, and even Ken soon turns against Lotso.\\n\\nThe eagerness of the group and Woody to return to Andy incites Lotso to declare that love doesn\\'t exist. It is then that Woody mentions Daisy and produces the tag that Chuckles kept. Big Baby sees the tag, and Lotso declares that she didn\\'t love them and replaced them. Woody reminds Lotso that it was only him she replaced. This revelation causes Big Baby to reach for the tag before Lotso destroys it, yelling at Big Baby for being stupid and believing that Daisy loved him. Big Baby, feeling betrayed, then throws Lotso in the dumpster.\\n\\nThe other toys begin to run across the lid, but one of the Pizza Planet aliens\\' feet gets stuck in the lid. Woody goes to help him, only to have Lotso grab his hand. The others rush to help Woody, but just then, a dump truck pulls up and empties the contents of the dumpster (including Andy\\'s toys) into the collecting bin in the back. Barbie and Ken, who were not on the dumpster\\'s lid, can only watch as their friends are taken from them.\\n\\nInside the dumpster, more trash is emptied onto the group, and a TV set falls on Buzz &mdash; which sets him back to his proper self. However, before the toys can rejoice, the truck arrives at the Tri-County landfill. They\\'re shocked when a bulldozer scoops up the three Pizza Planet aliens, carrying them away! The remaining toys are shoveled by another machine onto a moving conveyor belt, headed towards a large shredding machine. The toys avoid being shredded by grabbing metal objects that are being magnetized to an overhead track. Woody and Buzz even manage to save Lotso, who thanks them.\\n\\nOnce they make it through, they find themselves on another conveyor belt, heading towards what looks like daylight. However, as they draw closer, they soon realize it\\'s a large pit that empties into a fiery incinerator. The toys try to outrun their fiery fate until Lotso notices an emergency stop switch. He motions for the others to help him, and they hoist him up to stop the machine. However, once he reaches the button, Lotso just smirks at Woody, muttering \"Where\\'s your kid now, Sheriff?\" and runs off.\\n\\nThe toys are soon unable to keep running, and tumble into the pit. They try to climb out, but there appears to be no escape. With no hope left, the toys all join hands, willing to stay together to the very end.\\n\\nSuddenly, a blue light appears overhead, and a giant claw falls down, scooping up the group. As they wonder who rescued them, the enormous claw swings by the glass cabin of the machine, where the three Pizza Planet aliens are. Once the group gets out, they thank their saviors and wonder what became of Lotso.\\n\\nUnknown to them, Lotso is found by another garbageman at the dump. Remembering that he had a Lots-a-Huggin\\' Bear as a kid, he ties Lotso to the grille of his dump truck and he heads off for duty.\\n\\nAndy\\'s toys find the dump truck that services Andy\\'s neighborhood and manage to get back before Andy leaves for college. After cleaning themselves up, they sneak back into the house, finding Andy\\'s room cleaned out, except for some minimal items, and two boxes: one marked \\'College,\\' the other \\'Attic.\\'\\n\\nWoody\\'s friends pile into the \\'Attic\\' box, and say their goodbyes. Hearing Andy and his mom approaching, Woody hops in the \\'College\\' box. As they enter Andy\\'s room, his mother is hit with the sad reality that her son is going away. Andy tells her that even though he\\'ll be gone, he\\'ll still care about her.\\n\\nHearing this, Woody realizes that Andy can still care for him and the other toys: an example of true love, in that you never forget those you really love. While Andy is distracted by his sister Molly and his dog Buster, Woody grabs a Post-It note and a marker and writes down Bonnie\\'s street address. He takes the Post-It with him and hops into the \\'Attic\\' box.\\n\\nAndy returns to the room and sees the note on the \\'Attic\\' box. Thinking that his mom wrote it, Andy takes the box to the address and sees Bonnie playing in her family\\'s front yard with the same quirky imagination that he had.\\n\\nAndy gets out of the car with his box. As Bonnie sees him approach, she stops her game and calls for her mom. Bonnie\\'s mom (voice: Lori Alan) recognizes Andy, who explains that he has some toys for Bonnie. Andy introduces each of his toys, telling Bonnie a little bit about each of them, since he still remembers how he played with them: for example, Hamm saves your money but is also the evil Dr. Porkchop.\\n\\nWith each toy revealed, Bonnie gets more and more brave, until after Buzz, she peeks into the box and sees Woody. Andy has no knowledge of how Woody got in there, but is surprised when Bonnie calls him \"my cowboy doll,\" and quotes one of Woody\\'s lines: \"There\\'s a snake in my boot!\"\\n\\nAndy sees Bonnie looking at Woody, and explains to her how important Woody is to him: how long he\\'s had him, and how brave Woody can be. However, he explains to Bonnie that she can have Woody, if she promises to take good care of him, and the other toys. When she quietly nods an affirmative, Andy begins to play with her, and the two are having an imaginative time with their toys. Secretly, Andy\\'s toys are overjoyed at their last playtime with him.\\n\\nFinally, Andy gets into his car, as Bonnie gathers her old and new toys on the porch. As she holds Woody and Buzz in her little arms, she makes Woody wave goodbye. This causes Andy to give a sad but calming smile. \"Thanks, guys,\" he whispers, as he drives off.\\n\\nAfter Andy leaves, Bonnie\\'s mom takes her inside for lunch, leaving the toys on the porch, watching Andy\\'s car fade into the distance down the street. \"So long, partner,\" says Woody. Woody smiles at the other toys, reaffirming that Andy did care for them, and care for them enough to leave them with another child who will take care of them and give them many playtimes to come. Woody introduces his friends to Bonnie\\'s other toys.\\n\\nSome time afterward, the toys find a note in Bonnie\\'s backpack from Ken. In the time since Lotso has been gone, Ken and Barbie have worked to abolish the unfair system that ran Sunnyside, and now the toys have an equal opportunity to move between the Caterpillar and Butterfly rooms. The toys at Sunnyside now enjoy their time there, and soon after, Sarge and his two paratroopers arrive, with both Ken and Barbie welcoming them.', 'No Synopsis', '500 years prior, Kumandra was a prosperous land when evil spirits called the Druun began to ravage everything. They absorbed souls, turning those into stone. Eventually, the dragons of Kumandra used what was left of their magic to create an orb that not only warded off the Druun, but also restored everyone to life, with the exception of the dragons who remained turned to stone. The people all wanted the power of the orb which ultimately divided them into tribes based on their placement of a giant river made to resemble a dragon: Fang, Heart, Tail, Spine and Talon. Heart Tribe acquired the orb and has been guarding it ever since.\\n\\n500 years later, Chief Benga of the Heart Tribe has been training his daughter Raya to guard the orb. Despite this, he still believes that all the nations will set aside their differences and become Kumandra again. He resolves to invite all the nations over for a feast. Raya ends up befriending the daughter of Chief Virana of the Fang Tribe, Namaari, due to their shared interest in dragons. Namaari gives Raya a dragon pendant and she in turn shows her the location of the orb. However, Namaari betrays Raya and soon the Fang Tribe attempt to steal the orb. The rest of the tribes find out and a fight breaks out, resulting in the orb smashing to pieces. The Druun suddenly reawaken as each of the tribes steal a piece. Raya tries to rescue Benga, but he tells her to flee with the piece she has as he turns to stone.\\n\\nSix years later, Raya has been searching for the end of a stream to summon Sisu, the dragon who supposedly created the orb and the only surviving member of the species, to help her recover the missing orb pieces. She ends up in what is left of the desert like Tail Tribe and manages to summon Sisu. She admits that she did not create the orb and that her older siblings did, but finds that she can use their powers when she holds onto a piece. They find what is left of the Tail Temple and recover the second piece with Sisu now gaining the ability to turn into a human. They encounter Namaari and her tribe, but the two of them manage to escape on a boat driven by a young entrepreneur named Boun, who had lost his family to the Druun. Despite Boun being friendly, Raya refuses to divulge that Sisu is a dragon, nor tell him of her quest, confusing Sisu.\\n\\nThey arrive at the Talon Tribe, who have built their homes over the water to protect themselves against the Druun, as Raya tries to find their leader so that she can reclaim the orb piece. While out in the town, Raya encounters a \"con baby\" named Little Noi and her trio of monkey-like companions the Ongis, who adopted her after her mother was lost to the Druun. After a chase, Raya decides to hire them to help her. Sisu goes into town to look for a gift, as she thinks it is better than fighting, only to run into the real tribe leader who threatens her. Raya rescues her and reclaims the piece, which allows Sisu to make smoke clouds, and make it back to Boun with Noi and the Ongis joining them.\\n\\nThe group arrive at the Spine Tribe with Raya and Sisu attempting to enter the village. They are caught by the sole survivor of the tribe, a fearsome warrior named Tong, who actually does not know what to do with them. The rest of the group arrive to warn them of Namaari\\'s arrival. Raya holds her off in a fight while the others escape. However, Sisu reverts to her dragon form and fends off Namaari and the Fang Tribe. Before leaving, Namaari is moved by the appearance of Sisu. She returns to Virana to tell her, but she instead demands that she reclaim the pieces and the dragon as she fears that the other tribes will try to take what they have. Back at the boat, Raya finally comes clean to her party about Sisu and they agree to work together with Tong giving the orb piece he had been guarding and allowing Sisu to gain the ability to summon the rains.\\n\\nAs they get close to the Fang Tribe, Raya suggests breaking in to reclaim the final piece, but Sisu suggests giving them a gift and asking it back. When Raya refuses, Sisu takes her back to what is left of the Heart Tribe and reveals the fate of her siblings. While Sisu did not create the orb, her siblings trusted her enough to do the right thing with it. Raya gives in and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a piece offering so that she can rejoin the rest of the orb pieces. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari, but as soon as she shows the remainder of the orb pieces, Namaari holds a crossbow to them. Sisu tries to talk her down, but Raya, sensing that Namaari will shoot, attacks her, causing Sisu to get hit by the arrow and falls into a river. Namaari flees as the water, which protected the Fang Tribe against the Druun, begins to recede.\\n\\nThe Fang Tribe is attacked by the Druun as Raya enters to confront Namaari, who is grieving Virana\\'s fate at the hands of the Druun. The two fight while Tong, Boun, Noi and the Ongis rescue the people from the Druun. Raya prepares to strike down Namaari, but she tells her that she has lost everything and does not care anymore. Raya comes to her senses and she goes to help her friends. Namaari in turn helps the group using her orb piece. As the pieces start losing power, they fall into a pit and are surrounded by the Druun. Raya tells them that they need to put the pieces together, but her friends refuse to help Namaari. To show her faith, Raya puts her piece down and allows the Druun to take her. One by the one the rest follow with Namaari putting the pieces together and getting consumed by the Druun afterwards. The plan works and the Druun are vanquished as everyone is brought back to life.\\n\\nThe dragons are all brought back to life as they revive Sisu who thanks Raya for trusting others. Everyone returns to their significant others as Raya returns home to be reunited with Benga. She introduces him to Sisu as all the tribes come together peacefully to celebrate.', 'The film opens with young Anna (voice of Hadley Gannaway) and Elsa (voice of Mattea Conforti) playing a game with Elsa\\'s snow creations in an enchanted forest of their own creation. King Agnarr (voice of Alfred Molina) and Queen Iduna (voice of Evan Rachel Wood) enter, and Agnarr tells the girls he has seen an enchanted forest in real life. In his youth, he joined his father, King Runeard (voice of Jeremy Sisto), and other Arendellian soldiers to venture into the Enchanted Forest, where they came to know the four spirits of the forest - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Suddenly, the forest\\'s inhabitants, the Northuldra, started attacking the Arendellians, and Agnarr lost his father before losing consciousness. He recalls being saved by a mysterious being. After he finishes his story, Iduna sings a lullaby to the girls (\"All Is Found\").\\n\\nIn the present day, Elsa (now voiced by Idina Menzel) hears a melodic voice calling out to her, but nobody else can hear the sound. Anna (now voiced by Kristen Bell) joins Olaf (voice of Josh Gad) outside as he contemplates the changes around him. Anna isn\\'t bothered by changes because she has all the people she loves (\"Some Things Never Change\"). Meanwhile, Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) tells Sven that he is planning on proposing to Anna.\\n\\nLater that night, the gang plays charades together, but Elsa hears the voice calling out to her again. Distressed, she leaves the room. Kristoff tries to find a good time to propose to Anna, but she is more concerned with how Elsa is acting. After assuring her sister she is going to be fine, they go to bed.\\n\\nThe voice continues to call Elsa through the night, leading her to leave her room and wonder what it is that is calling her, and how she wants to learn more about it (\"Into The Unknown\"). The magic around her shows her images of mysterious creatures. Suddenly, Arendelle begins to experience strange occurrences. A strong wind blows into the kingdom, the water from the fountains drain out, the fire from the lanterns go out, and the earth begins to tremble fiercely. Elsa helps lead the citizens to higher ground.\\n\\nThe gang meets with Grand Pabbie (voice of Ciaran Hinds) and the other Trolls. He tells the sisters that the spirits of the Enchanted Forest are angered over a wrongdoing that must be corrected, or else Arendelle\\'s future will be in jeopardy. Elsa decides she must set off on her own to fix it, but Anna refuses to let her go alone. Naturally, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf join as well.\\n\\nEveryone travels far from Arendelle until they eventually reach the outside of the Enchanted Forest, which is surrounded by a gigantic mist. They are pulled inside and find themselves unable to get out. The group gets separated from each other, with Olaf wandering by himself and not understanding the weird things happening in the Forest (\"When I Am Older\"). A tornado created by the Air Spirit then pulls everyone away, but Elsa tries to stop it with her powers. In the midst of everything, she sees what look like images of memories shown through water. She freezes these images, with one that looks like a young Agnarr, and the Northuldra girl that saved him. The Air Spirit appears to have calmed down, gently blowing across the group, and Olaf even names it \"Gale.\"\\n\\nThe gang is then approached by a tribe of Northuldra led by Yelena (voice of Martha Plimpton), as well as Arendellian soldiers led by Lt. Destin Mattias (voice of Sterling K. Brown), whom Anna recognizes from a portrait in their castle. They become aware of Elsa\\'s powers quickly, and Olaf even takes time to recap their last adventure together to everyone. Soon, they are attacked by the Fire Spirit, which starts to spread bright colored flames across everything. Elsa once again uses her ice magic to contain the flames. She then follows the Fire Spirit until it appears as nothing more than a little salamander named Bruni. When he sees that Elsa means him no harm, he settles his flames and warms up to her (no pun intended). They hear the mysterious calling once again. After Anna gets Elsa, they run back to the ice statues Elsa made and realize that the girl who saved Agnarr was Iduna, meaning their mother was Northuldra, and the spirits rewarded her deed by giving her a daughter with powers. This revelation allows the Arendellians and Northuldra to form a truce.\\n\\nKristoff meets a Northuldra reindeer tamer named Ryder (voice of Jason Ritter), and the two of them bond over the way they treat their reindeer (specifically the way they give their reindeer voices). He tells Kristoff that because of the mist, most of the people there have only lived in the Forest and have never seen the outside world. Elsa befriends Ryder\\'s sister Honeymaren (voice of Rachel Matthews), who shows Elsa that in addition to the four main spirits, there is a fifth spirit that acts as a bridge between the other spirits. After witnessing Earth Giants roaming across the land, Anna notices Kristoff is gone, not realizing he is with Ryder, who has tried to help Kristoff come up with an elaborate proposal. She takes off with Elsa and Olaf, which leads Kristoff to think she has gone away after learning this from Yelena. He expresses his sorrow but also how strong his love for Anna is (\"Lost in the Woods\").\\n\\nAnna, Elsa, and Olaf continue their journey until they come across the ruins of Agnarr and Iduna\\'s ship. Through the water memories, Elsa learns that they set off to find answers about Elsa\\'s powers, even witnessing their final moments where they embraced as the waters consumed them. They search the ship until they find a map, revealing that their parents were headed for the fabled river of Ahtohallan. Elsa knows she has to go there alone, so she sends Anna and Olaf away on an ice boat that she makes. The two express their anger over Elsa ditching them, even if she did it for their own good.\\n\\nElsa attempts to get to Ahtohallan across the water, but she keeps getting taken down by the Water Spirit, which appears as a Nokk. After taming the spirit, she rides it as she follows the voice, eager to find out where it\\'s coming from (\"Show Yourself\"). Once she reaches Ahtohallan, she comes across her own memories and learns that the voice is that of Iduna calling out to her. When Elsa tries to find out what went wrong, she learns the truth: Runeard wanted to subjugate the Northuldra by creating a dam to limit their resources due to their reliance on magic, which Runeard hated. When the Northuldra leader tried to reason with him, Runeard murdered him while he was unarmed. Elsa gets too deep into Ahtohallan, which causes her to turn to solid ice, but not before she sends this information to Anna. Before she and Olaf set off to help, Olaf begins to disintegrate, realizing something is wrong with Elsa. Anna holds Olaf, and they reaffirm their love for each other before he is gone. Anna sits alone in despair until she picks herself up and vows to push forward (\"The Next Right Thing\").\\n\\nAnna knows that the dam must be destroyed, even if it means sending a flood toward Arendelle. She goes to wake up the Earth Giants and gets them to follow her toward the dam. Mattias sees this and tries to stop Anna, but after she convinces him that Elsa learned the truth about the dam and why it must be destroyed, he relents and lures the Giants there. The Giants hurl boulders to the dam, which breaks it and sends the water flowing toward the kingdom. Elsa is revived, and she rides the Nokk back to Arendelle where she freezes the water and brings it down before it hits Arendelle, thus saving the kingdom and lifting the mist in the Forest, freeing the soldiers and Northuldra.\\n\\nElsa reunites with Anna and the two sisters hug. Kristoff and Sven run down there too, and Elsa revives Olaf. Anna and Elsa determine that Elsa is the fifth spirit, as she has become the bridge between the other spirits. Kristoff then finally manages to propose to Anna with something simple, and she excitedly accepts. The Giants then appear to show their respect and gratitude toward Anna and Elsa.\\n\\nAfter returning to Arendelle, Anna becomes the new queen, as Elsa has decided to stay in the Forest where she is needed. The sisters regularly keep in touch, and Elsa rides the Nokk back to Arendelle for a visit.', \"Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler) is the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, a five-star resort where the world's monsters can be safe from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), Bigfoot, Steve the Blob, and other monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez). However, Mavis prefers to explore the outside world with her father's permission, but the village he directs her to is actually an elaborate deception to convince her of the threat of humans enough to coax her back.\\n\\nHowever, this charade inadvertently attracts the attention of an ordinary young traveler named Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg) who was exploring the surrounding forest and followed the staff to the hotel. Once Jonathan enters the hotel, Dracula frantically attempts to hide him from the patrons such as disguising him as a Flesh Golem named Johnny-stein with the later hasty cover story of being a relative of one of Frank's body parts. Eventually, Jonathan is discovered by Mavis and company, forcing Dracula to claim he is going to arrange Mavis' birthday party with a young perspective. In doing so, Jonathan manages to charm everyone at the hotel, especially Mavis. Eventually, even Dracula begins to like the human taking him into his confidence about his family's traumatic past after the vampire notices the young man knows something about them in a respectful manner.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Chef Quasimodo Wilson (Jon Lovitz) realizes Jonathan is human and captures him to cook him, forcing Dracula to directly intervene by magically freezing the chef. Eventually, the birthday party happens and it is a raucous success until Dracula freaks out when Mavis and Jonathan have an innocent kiss. A ranting Dracula accidentally lets it slip that he tricked Mavis at the fake village and Mavis is outraged at being manipulated by her own father. Things get worse when a still-frozen Chef Quasimodo interrupts the party as the Fly (Chris Parnell) translates his frozen language to the clientele which states that Jonathan is actually a human. Even as the clientele are revolted, Mavis still accepts and expresses her desire to be with Jonathan even though he is human. For his part, Jonathan feels obliged to reject Mavis for her father's sake and leaves the hotel. Afterward, Dracula realizes that in his efforts to protect Mavis, he has broken her heart and now she tearfully wants to stay at the hotel forever.\\n\\nWishing to undo his mistake, Dracula persuades his friends to help him find Jonathan and even risks his destruction by venturing out in the daylight to do so. Learning that Jonathan is about to board a flight out of Transylvania Airport shortly, they race on and enter a town en route. At that town, Dracula and company are stunned to see the humans having a 'Monster Festival'. To clear a path, Frankenstein tries to scare them, but finds the humans are cheerfully welcoming them instead and even provide a shaded route through the town for Dracula to proceed at maximum speed.\\n\\nHowever, Dracula finds that he is too late with Jonathan's plane taking off. With no alternative, Dracula desperately flies after it in broad daylight despite being hurt by the sun. With much effort, Dracula manages to reach the plane and resorts to mind-controlling one of the pilots (Brian Stack) to apologize and tell Jonathan that he wants him to return to be with his daughter. Jonathan accepts Dracula's apology and Dracula manipulates the plane back to the airport.\\n\\nLater, Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, who tells her that she's his 'zing' and the reason why he had to reject her. Dracula gives his blessing to their relationship, Jonathan and Mavis kiss and the hotel has another party to celebrate his daughter's liberating coming of age before Jonathan and Mavis set off on their travels.\\n\\nThe film ends with Dracula and his friends being shown in traditional animation (in the style of Genndy Tartakovsky's cartoons) during the credits.\", 'No Synopsis', 'At New York City\\'s Central Park Zoo, Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) is walking on a treadmill, daydreaming about running free in the wild. He swings on vines, jumps, does flips and runs through a bunch of singing penguins. Marty is jolted back to reality by his best friend, Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), who gets in his face and roars.\\n\\nAlex tells Marty that there\\'s something in his teeth, so Marty tells him to open his mouth and let Dr. Marty, D.D.S., have a look. Marty reaches in and extracts a glass ball with a red ribbon on top. It\\'s a snow globe, with a miniature Alex figure in the middle. It\\'s a tenth birthday present for Marty from Alex. Marty puts the globe among a bunch of other \"Alex\" themed items that he\\'d been given over time. The gift did not excite him. In fact, he\\'s bored and upset that his life at the zoo limits his ability to enjoy life more fully by keeping his movements restricted.\\n\\nToday was not only Marty\\'s birthday, but \"Field Trip Day\" at the zoo, when all the school kids come. It was one of Alex\\'s favorite days, and he excitedly woke up his other friends, Gloria the hippopotamus and Melman the giraffe, so they could get themselves ready. That\\'s difficult for Melman, as he\\'s a hypochondriac and worries about all sorts of ailments he thinks he may have.\\n\\nAlex quickly counsels Marty to work on changing his attitude, suggesting that he approach every day in a \"fresh\" way. So, Marty decides he\\'s going to be \"fresh\" today.\\n\\nMason the Chimpanzee (Conrad Vernon) starts his day off by rummaging through the waste can and coming up with a cup of coffee, bagel and newspaper, which he shares with his companion, Phil, another chimpanzee, who can\\'t speak and just uses sign language.\\n\\nOnce the gates to the zoo open, Gloria, Marty and Alex go into action, putting on an exhibition of dancing, posing, and doing acrobatics for the visiting people. They were very popular.\\n\\nThere are four penguins at the zoo who are in the process of digging an escape tunnel. They are using plastic spoons and popsicle sticks to dig with, but their tools keep breaking and slowing them down.\\n\\nMarty is surprised when there\\'s a small area of the grass in his compound that suddenly bulges upward, and the head of Skipper the penguin (Tom McGrath) appears, followed by those of his fellow penguins: Private (Christopher Knights), Kowalski (Chris Miller), and Rico. One of them asks what continent this is, and Marty says, \"Manhattan.\" They realize that they\\'ve somewhat missed the mark, as their destination was Antarctica, so they go back down to continue digging, but first swearing Marty to silence.\\n\\nMarty, Gloria, Melman and Alex all get V.I.P. treatments after the zoo closes, with the freshest of whatever foods they prefer, massages, and acupuncture. It\\'s about as good as a life of confinement can be.\\n\\nGloria\\'s birthday gift to Marty is a cake, while Melman gives him a thermometer, not telling him it\\'s his old rectal thermometer until Marty had put it in his mouth to try it out.\\n\\nMarty\\'s birthday wish is to go to the wild. When Marty tells his skeptical friends that the penguins are trying to escape to the wild, Alex replies, \"the penguins are psychotic.\" They engage in a discussion about where the nearest wild might be, and Gloria says she heard there are wild places in Connecticut.\\n\\nAlex tells Marty that there wouldn\\'t be things like the fresh steaks he likes so much out in the wild. When Marty asks his friends if they aren\\'t bothered by not knowing about the world outside the zoo, they simultaneously say, \"no.\"\\n\\nMarty continues to be depressed, so Gloria makes Alex go and attempt to give him a pep talk. Alex knows that if he sings \"New York, New York,\" that Marty won\\'t be able to resist joining in, so he does that. Marty does join in, but the noise they make causes the other animals to start waking up and they shout out for Marty and Alex to \"shut up.\"\\n\\nMarty tries to convince Alex to join him in breaking out and traveling north to Connecticut. Alex isn\\'t interested, besides tomorrow is \"Senior\\'s Day,\" at the zoo and he doesn\\'t want to miss that.\\n\\nLater that night, after the animals have all gotten back to sleep, Alex is wakened by Melman, who normally wakes up every two hours to pee. Melman tells Alex that Marty wasn\\'t in his compound. Gloria comes over too, and they all wonder where Marty might be. Alex grabs a nearby phone and calls 911, before he realizes \"we can\\'t call the people.\"\\n\\nMarty is sauntering down a main street in downtown New York, headed for Grand Central Station. He stares at a woman walking by who is wearing a zebra striped outfit. He spends some time ice skating at an ice rink, then stops and talks to a police horse (David Cowgill), who gives him directions to Grand Central. The police officer (Stephen Apostolina), riding the horse calls into the precinct and asks if he can shoot the zebra. He is told no, that it\\'s animal control\\'s responsibility.\\n\\nMelman lifts Alex over the zoo wall and lowers him to the street. Gloria just busts through the brick wall, and Melman follows her out. Mason and Phil also go out through the hole in the wall. They all go to the nearest subway station and get in one of the cars, scaring and upsetting all the passengers. Before boarding the train, Melway goes into a restroom and comes out with one of those blue deodorizers in his mouth (he liked how it tasted).\\n\\nThe animals ride the subway down to Grand Central Station, which is the same place Marty went. Wherever Alex goes, the humans all freak out and run, which he doesn\\'t understand because he\\'s not after them at all. There\\'s an old lady (Elisa Gabrielli) who isn\\'t afraid of him, and actually calls him a \"bad kitty\" and proceeds to start beating on him with her purse.\\n\\nWhen they find Marty, Alex rushes forward and tackles him, then hugs him, and finally chokes him, alternating in his emotions of concern, relief and anger. Marty tells Alex that he was going to come back to the zoo in the morning, after his little excursion to Connecticut.\\n\\nHundreds of police show up and surround the animals. By then, the penguins and chimps have arrived and joined Marty, Alex, Gloria and Melman at the station. All the humans are on edge, and very afraid, especially of Alex. Except the old woman, who kicks Alex in the groin.\\n\\nAlex attempts to speak to the police and reason with them, but they don\\'t understand him. So, he roars, in imitation of his popular daily zoo performance. The animal control officer is finally able to steady his nerves enough to shoot Alex in the butt with a tranquilizer dart. That puts Alex out. When Alex starts coming to, he\\'s back at the zoo and there\\'s an animal rights activist making a speech to a crowd about how the zoo animals should be returned to the wild. When they see Alex coming awake, they all get scared and run. Animal Control again responds by shooting at Alex with multiple darts. One of them hits him in the paw and he goes back to sleep.\\n\\nThe next time Alex wakes up, he\\'s in a wooden crate, as are Marty, Gloria, Melman, the penguins and the chimps. They are on a large ship that is sailing to Africa. The boxes that the animals are in are all labeled: \"Kenyan Wildlife Preserve.\" Phil can read, so he signs that bit of information to Mason, who informs the rest of them.\\n\\nRico coughs up a paper clip and uses it to pick the lock to the box holding the penguins. The four of them then waddle their way up to the bridge, disabling a crewman along the way, and administering a karate chop to the back of the neck of the captain of the ship, taking him out.\\n\\nAlex, Marty and Gloria all start arguing about their predicament and what they should do. Meanwhile, the penguins are on the bridge of the ship and struggling to figure out how to steer and navigate it. They more or less accidentally figure it out and Skipper orders hard right rudder. When the ship lurches, the crates holding Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman, all fall overboard and are set adrift as the ship moves away.\\n\\nAfter traveling some distance, the crate holding Alex starts rolling and bouncing. It comes to a sudden stop and breaks open, sending Alex head over heels onto a sandy beach. He comes up coughing, with a mouthful of sand. He\\'s all alone and spends a long time roaming the beach, calling out to his friends, and at one point, he even calls for Regis, Kelly, Matt, Katie, and Al.\\n\\nSuddenly, there\\'s the sound of another voice and Alex looks up to see a crate with four legs sticking out of the bottom, running around the beach. It\\'s Melman. Alex hurries over and attempts to free Melman from the crate. He pulls Melman\\'s neck way out, but that doesn\\'t work, so he grabs a coconut tree log and prepares to ram it into Melman\\'s stomach to force him out of the crate. He steps way back, points the log, and starts running. Just before he slams into Melman, something distracts him and he stops short. Coming onto the beach through the surf is a large crate containing Gloria. Once the crate hits the beach, Gloria kicks one side of her crate out, freeing herself and at the same time sending Alex flying through the air and crashing down on top of Melman, smashing his crate and freeing him. There are two starfish and a crab covering Gloria\\'s private parts, so she announces that \"the party\\'s over,\" and they all scatter.\\n\\nMarty is next to arrive, only he does so in style, riding onto the beach on the backs of some dolphins. Alex is surprised to see Marty, but in short order he realizes that all this grief he and the others are experiencing is because of Marty, so he starts chasing Marty around the beach, intending to beat him up. Melman and Gloria intervene and the four of them begin wondering just where they are. Melman looks around and offers his opinion that they are somewhere near San Diego, given the terrain and vegetation. Alex decides to chase Marty some more, because he doesn\\'t want to be in San Diego where he likely won\\'t be the star of the zoo anymore. Gloria stops Alex.\\n\\nAlex hears some sounds coming from deep in the jungle. It sounds like humans, so they all charge off towards the noise. Alex has trouble when he keeps running into things, including a large spider web, that causes him to fall behind. Meanwhile, Gloria, Melman and Marty come across a clearing that is filled with about a hundred lemurs of various sizes and ages. They don\\'t recognize what sort of animals the lemurs are, just that they definitely aren\\'t human. They watch the lemurs as they dance, sing and generally carry on. Melman tells the others that he\\'s counted 27 health code violations taking place.\\n\\nA lemur named Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) calls for quiet and introduces the lemur King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen). King Julien then launches into a rap song, \"I Like to Move It.\" The lemurs are all enjoying themselves when suddenly an alarm is sounded and a lemur shouts that the fossa are coming. There are four fossa, which are animals that look like a cross between a cat and a dog, and prey on the lemurs. The lemurs all run, but the fossa catch a baby lemur named Mort (Andy Richter), and start making a salad, with Mort as the main ingredient.\\n\\nAlex finally catches up with his friends and as he gazes down on the scene before him, Gloria sees a large spider on his back. She picks up a stick, preparing to swat the spider. Before she can do that, the spider speaks, saying hello. That causes Alex to look and when he sees the spider, he freaks out, letting out a huge roar, which frightens the fossa and they run away, allowing the Mort lemur to escape. Meanwhile, Gloria starts hammering away at the spider on Alex\\'s back, nearly beating him unconscious in the process.\\n\\nKing Julien and his fellow lemurs don\\'t know what to make of the strange animals who have suddenly appeared and scared the fossa away. He decides they must be aliens. To confirm whether the aliens are friendly or not, the king grabs Mort and tosses him towards them. Alex approaches Mort and attempts to make friends, but he\\'s frightened of him and cries. Gloria picks up baby Mort and calms him down. The king now decides that these aliens are a bunch of pansies.\\n\\nKing Julien, aka, \"The Lord of the Lemurs,\" steps forward and says, \"welcome giant pansies!\" Alex decides that all the lemurs must be some sort of squirrels, because they act so weird. The king asks \"where are you giants from?\" and when Alex says, \"New York,\" the king says, \"All hail the New York Giants!\"\\n\\nAlex asks the king about any people on the island, knowing that they need people to come find and rescue them. The king says there are people on the island, but they aren\\'t very active. He then points up at a tree, where there\\'s a skeleton hanging from a parachute. Not far away are the remnants of an airplane, also perched high in a tree. The king says there are no live people on the island.\\n\\nAlex loses it and takes off for the beach, intending to jump in the ocean and swim back to New York. Gloria again has to stop him and calm him down. She assures him that the people must be missing them and should be coming at any time to rescue them.\\n\\nMelman decides their situation is hopeless and he digs himself a grave there on the beach. Extending out from the grave is a long will and testament that he\\'d written in the sand. He starts to read it to the others, informing them of what he will leave to each of them, when a wave comes rolling in and erases the bottom third of the will. Melman says, \"sorry Alex,\" as that portion of the will pertained to Alex\\'s inheritance.\\n\\nMarty decides that he doesn\\'t care if the humans come to find and rescue them, because he loves his newfound freedom there in the wild. That upsets Alex and he takes that large coconut log and draws a line in the sand, telling Marty that he must stay on the other side of that line, while Alex and the others, who want to be rescued, will stay on the opposite side. That doesn\\'t bother Marty, as he immediately sets about building himself a little beachside patio, complete with a large umbrella, fire pit, bar and lounge seats.\\n\\nAlex starts building something too. It ends up being a large figure, similar to the Statue of Liberty, and he calls it the \"Beacon of Liberty.\" His intent is to set it ablaze once they see a ship out on the ocean, so the people will see it and come to their rescue. While Marty has already started a little fire in his fire pit, Alex has ordered Melman to work on starting a fire for them. Melman is getting very tired rubbing two sticks together, trying to create a spark. However, he eventually does get some sparks, then flames, but the flames catch the sticks on fire and Melman becomes frightened and starts running around. He accidentally sets the Beacon of Liberty on fire and it quickly burns down. Alex can\\'t believe it.\\n\\nBack at the lemurs place, the king is telling his fellow lemurs that he wants to make the New York Giants their friends, especially Alex, who would then keep the fossa away from them. Maurice then poses a question to them all, asking them to consider why it is the fossa are afraid of Alex, and perhaps the lemurs should be afraid of him too. No one seems particularly concerned.\\n\\nBack on the beach, Alex has built another structure, made of coconut logs. This one spells out the word, \"HELP.\"\\n\\nMelman and Gloria decide to join Marty on the \"fun side\" of the island, and are over sitting under the umbrella, near the fire pit. Marty invites Alex to join them, telling him that it\\'s not really the fun side without him there. Marty continues to refuse. As he sits there pouting, the \"P\" in his help sign collapses.\\n\\nAfter some time, Alex decides to go over to the fun side, apologizing to Marty and asking to join the others. Marty welcomes him to \"Casa del Wild,\" and prepares Alex a drink, which he serves to him in a coconut shell. Alex takes a big gulp and immediately spits it out. Marty has to explain that the drinks are just sea water, but that\\'s only until the plumbing is fixed. Gloria, Melman, Marty and Alex then continue sipping their drinks and spitting it out.\\n\\nMarty then prepares something he calls \"seaweed on a stick,\" and offers some up to his friends. Gloria and Melman think it\\'s very tasty, but Alex starts choking when he eats it. He is very hungry for meat, and misses the steaks he used to eat at the zoo in New York. After he falls asleep, he dreams about steak, and he starts to lick one. He is jolted awake by the others and finds himself licking Marty\\'s backside. Marty wants to know what Alex thinks he\\'s doing. Alex pretends to have been counting Marty\\'s stripes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, 2,500 miles to the south, the penguins have arrived at their dream destination, Antarctica, and are standing quietly on the ice, near the bow of the ship. The wind is blowing and there\\'s nothing around them except ice and snow as far as the eye can see. Finally, Private turns to the others and says, \"well, this sucks.\"\\n\\nKing Julien and all the lemurs make noise and wake up Alex and the others, surprising them by leading them to an overlook where they gaze out upon a huge expanse of open area, with beautiful green grass, trees and waterfalls visible way in the distance. The king says, \"Welcome to Madagascar.\"\\n\\nIt all looks just like the poster that Marty had on the wall back in New York. It was just like the land in his dreams. He and Alex rush forward and romp through the grass, wrestling and teasing each other as they went. Alex tires temporarily, as he hadn\\'t eaten for a long time, but rediscovers that he has more energy than ever and continues his romp.\\n\\nMarty suggests to Alex that he perform his zoo routine for the lemurs. When Julien hears Alex refer to himself as a \"king,\" he becomes concerned, thinking that there can\\'t be two kings on Madagascar.\\n\\nThe fossa arrive and observe Alex\\'s performance from behind some rocks. As Alex continues his performance, he looks out over the crowd, comprised of the lemurs and his friends, and they all start to look like steaks to him. When Alex lets out a huge roar, the fossa run off and everyone else decides to run as well, because Alex is attacking. When Alex snaps out of his hunger induced temporary insanity, he has his jaws attached to Marty\\'s butt, but he hadn\\'t bitten down yet.\\n\\nMaurice takes advantage of the moment to educate everyone about the fact that Alex is an apex predator, and if he\\'s hungry, no one is safe. About that time, Alex sees steaks again and starts another attack. He always seems to hone in on Marty as his target of choice. Alex is about to pounce on Marty when Maurice fires a coconut from atop a tree and beans Alex with it, saving Marty.\\n\\nAlex recovers and is very upset at himself for attacking Marty. He\\'s worried what might happen, so he runs off. He falls into a river and ends up floating to another part of the island, the place where the fossa live. There, he sharpens a bunch of sticks and inserts them into the ground, sharp sides up. He\\'s created a sort of jail for himself, with the sticks at the base of some rocks and himself sitting on the rocks.\\n\\nMarty, Gloria and Melman also find themselves roaming around in the land of the predators, where the fossa live. As they walk, they observe several small animals get eaten up by much larger predators, and they are not at all comfortable.\\n\\nA boat horn sounds out on the ocean, so Marty, Gloria and Melman hurry to the beach. They see the same ship that they\\'d been on earlier. Melman struggles to hoist Gloria up high on his head, his neck bending severely as he does it, but her waving seems to work, as the ship begins to turn around and head for the island. Marty decides to hurry and go find Alex, but Gloria stops him, knowing he wouldn\\'t last long in the land of the predators.\\n\\nThe ship arrives at the island and the bow comes right up onto the beach, flush against Melman\\'s face, as he\\'s standing there in shocked amazement. The anchor drops onto the beach and the four penguins appear. Gloria asks them where the people from the ship are and Skipper tells her that they \"are on a slow lifeboat to China.\"\\n\\nDuring the distraction of the ship coming aground on the island, Marty has run off to go find Alex. He finds him sitting in his little jail enclosure. Alex talks to Marty for a little bit, then lunges and takes a swipe at him. He couldn\\'t help it, he was so hungry. He regains his senses and goes deeper into the rocks to hide. Marty follows him partway and tells Alex he isn\\'t going anywhere without him. He starts to sing, \"New York, New York.\" Alex doesn\\'t respond.\\n\\nThe fossa have arrived and are gathering around Marty in force. Soon, they attack and Marty has to run, calling for help. Just as it appears Marty is doomed, Melman and Gloria arrive. Melman sweeps down from on high and scoops up Marty, carrying him to safety. The penguins are there too, and Skipper steps forward, producing a flare gun which he fires into the air, distracting the fossa. He and the other penguins then quickly rig up a device using the steering wheel from the ship, and spin it around rapidly, striking the attacking fossa and knocking them unconscious.\\n\\nAlex shows up, roaring and showing his teeth. He makes as though he\\'s attacking Marty, claiming Marty as his territory, as his meal. Marty is about to faint, thinking Alex is really going to eat him, until Alex whispers to him that it\\'s all for show.\\n\\nAlex then grabs Marty, Gloria and Melman and hoists them all above his head, proclaiming to the fossa that they all belong to him. Then he sets the three back on the ground and starts taking it directly to the fossa, knocking them this way and that, until they all decide to run off. He shouts at them to never come back.\\n\\nThe king observes all this and becomes very happy that his plan had worked out after all.\\n\\nBack on the beach, Rico is working feverishly as a chef, preparing some sushi, which is then fed to Alex. Alex is tentative, but he tries it and decides he likes it. He orders 300 pieces to go.\\n\\nEveryone enjoys themselves at the \"Thank You Freaks,\" banquet put on by the lemurs. There\\'s a massive toast, with everyone taking a drink from their coconut cups and then simultaneously spitting it right back out.\\n\\nMarty tells his friends that he\\'s ok with just staying on Madagascar, or going back to New York, just as long as he can be with his friends. They decide to go back to New York.\\n\\nThe king gives Alex his crown, then produces a new one for himself. His new crown is larger and has a live gecko on it.\\n\\nMarty, Alex, Gloria, and Melman board the ship. The chimps are still there too. The ship is loaded with lots of fresh fruit and sushi, ready to sail. Alex envisions them making some side trips, since it will be winter at the New York zoo. The penguins, however, are all sitting in beach chairs, sunning themselves. One of them wonders if they should tell those on the ship that it\\'s out of gas.', \"Milo James Thatch is a bright young man, who is in the employ of the Smithsonian Institution (as their resident maintenance man). Milo has been inspired by his Grandfather, who often spoke of finding the Lost Continent of Atlantis. Milo attempts to convince several of the top people at the Smithsonian to fund an expedition, but almost all of them think him crazy.\\n\\nComing home one evening, Milo meets Helga Sinclair, who escorts him to the home of eccentric millionaire Preston B Whitmore. Preston claims to have known Milo's Grandfather, and presents him with a journal, that contains information about reaching Atlantis. Preston claims that he has a crew ready to go, but wants Milo to head the expedition. The young man eagerly accepts.\\n\\nThe expedition takes them to the waters off the coat of Iceland, where a giant submersible takes them to the ocean floor. Milo cautions the crew that something know as The Leviathan may be guarding the entrance to Atlantis. It turns out that the Leviathan is a giant mechanical sea creature, that ends up destroying the sub. Luckily, Milo and some of the crew escape, finding themselves in an underground cavern.\\n\\nAfter braving several pitfalls and strange creatures, they finally make it to Atlantis, preserved in a sunken atmosphere. However, before they can approach, they are accosted by several natives, led by the King's daughter, Kida. Milo is soon able to communicate with the natives, and they soon reveal they know many different languages, including English. Kida leads the group into Atlantis, where she takes them to her father.\\n\\nKida's father is not at all pleased to meet these strangers, and requests that they leave. However, a member of the expedition party named Rourke requests to stay one day, and is granted this request.\\n\\nAfter they are dismissed from the chambers, Milo explains that he feels the King is hiding something, and Rourke says he wants to know what. Milo is requested by the others to gain this information, and soon after meets with Kida. While Milo wants to know more about Atlantis, Kida is curious about the outside world.\\n\\nMilo shows Kida the journal, and also finds that the Atlanteans' crystals around their necks also function as a key that can animate stone objects with flight. Kida explains that their civilization has lost the ability to read their own language, but Milo is able to decode the text on sunken ruins under the city. According to the information, there is a crystal that connects to the necklaces worn by the Atlanteans, and is considered their 'heart.'\\n\\nMilo and Kida are soon accosted by Rourke, who it is revealed has come to Atlantis to find the crystal for monetary purposes. The others and Helga are soon found to be in on the scheme as well, and go to the King. The King denies any knowledge of the crystal's whereabouts, but Rourke soon finds a secret underground entrance under the throne room, where the enormous crystal is kept.\\n\\nAs the group watches, Kida suddenly takes on a blue-glow in her eyes, and ascends towards the crystal. As they watch, the crystal fuses with her, making her a glowing blue figure.\\n\\nRourke and the rest of the team bring the 'Crystal/Kida' above-ground, sealing her in a metal box. Though at first the others help Rourke, as Milo reasons with them, soon only Helga accompanies Rourke and the other soldiers out of Atlantis. As they leave, the crystal necklaces on the Atlanteans dim together.\", \"The film begins with the news revealing that an Egyptian pyramid was stolen. When super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) hears of this, his pride is wounded and he plans to pull the biggest heist of the century by stealing the Moon.\\n\\nGru tries to get a loan from the Bank of Evil (Formerly Lehman Brothers) and meets a young super-villain, Vector (Jason Segel), who annoys him. Bank president Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett) refuses to grant Gru the loan until he obtains the shrink ray necessary for the plan. Mr. Perkins tells Gru that he is getting too old and that new super-villains are younger and better, like Vector, who is revealed to be the one who stole the Pyramid of Giza.\\n\\nGru and his minions steal the shrink ray from a top secret research facility in East Asia, but Vector steals it from him and shrinks his ship. Gru attempts to get the shrink ray back from Vector's lair, but all his attempts to enter the lair prove futile. After seeing three orphaned girls, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) enter the lair to sell cookies to Vector. Gru adopts the girls from Miss Hattie (Kristen Wiig), the head of the orphanage, to use them to steal back the shrink ray. Gru has his assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) build robots disguised as cookies. He then has the girls sell the robots to Vector, and the robots help Gru steal the shrink ray.\\n\\nOn the way home the girls ask to go to an amusement park. Gru agrees, intending to leave the girls there. Instead, the attendant says he, as an adult, has to ride the roller coaster with them. Gru ends up having fun with the girls. Back at home, he presents his plan to Mr. Perkins via video. The girls keep interrupting him. Perkins again refuses to give him the loan, claiming that although he doesn't have a problem with the plan, he just wants a younger villain to do it instead. Gru has a flashback of his childhood, depicting his wanting to go to the moon after seeing the first moon landing. When he tried to impress his mother (Julie Andrews) with models of the rocket (and an actual working one), she just ignored him. Mr. Perkins calls Vector (revealed to be his son, whose real name is Victor) to the Bank of Evil to inform him that Gru has the shrink ray. Vector reassures his father that he will get the Moon. Gru almost abandons his plan due to lack of funds, but the girls and the minions take up a collection to keep it going.\\n\\nHowever, Gru has to make a choice, because the moon will be in the optimal position for the heist on the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Dr. Nefario, seeing the girls as a distraction, contacts Miss Hattie, who arrives to take the girls back. Gru, the Minions, and the girls are heartbroken. Gru goes on with his plan and flies to the moon.\\n\\nGru successfully shrinks and pockets the Moon. Gru remembers the ballet recital and rushes to it. However, it has ended by the time he arrived. There, he finds a ransom note from Vector demanding the moon in exchange for the girls. After Gru hands over the moon, Vector reneges on the deal, keeping the girls and the moon. This enrages Gru, who storms Vector's lair, this time successfully breaching the defenses. Vector flies off in an escape pod with the girls. Gru holds on to the exterior of the ship. He nearly falls to his death, but is rescued by Dr. Nefario piloting the same ship that Vector shrunk before. Nefario reveals that the bigger the object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off. Very soon, the moon begins to grow and roll around inside Vector's ship, hurting him and freeing the girls. The girls see Gru outside of the ship, and Gru tells them to jump over to him. Edith and Agnes successfully make it onto the ship, but before Margo can jump, Vector grabs her. The moon rolls again and knocks Vector over, and Margo grabs onto Gru's grappling hook. Gru rescues her with the help of his minions, while the rapidly-expanding Moon wrecks Vector's controls, causing his ship to carry it back into orbit.\\n\\nGru and the girls settle down to live a happy life as a family and Vector is stranded on the Moon. The girls give a special ballet recital for Gru, his minions, and his mother, who finally tells him she is proud of him and acknowledges him to be the better parent. The music changes from Swan Lake to You Should Be Dancing, and everyone rushes on stage to dance as the film ends.\", 'No Synopsis', 'Vain, pampered and spoiled rich Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) goes about another day in which he is bowed and scraped to by myriad servants.\\n\\nAfter being unable to find a suitable bride from the regiment chosen by one of his staff, Kuzco finds his advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) sitting in his throne. Even though this upsets him, Kuzco decides to fire her from her position due to her age, causing Yzma to storm off in a rage with her assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton) following close behind.\\n\\nKuzco then meets up with Pacha (John Goodman), who is the head of a nearby village. Pacha is shown a model of his village, and asks to know where the most sun is. When Pacha gives his opinion, Kuzco horrifies the man when he places a large structure on top of the model that he dubs \"Kuzcotopia.\" Kuzco then explains that the next day at his Birthday celebration, the entire village will be destroyed for his new summer home. Upset at such a thing, Pacha tries to interject, but is taken away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Yzma is still upset over being fired by Kuzco, and decides to do away with him. As there\\'s no apparent heir to the throne, she figures she can easily take over, and going to her secret lab, finds a potion she intends to poison Kuzco with at dinner.\\n\\nHowever, at dinner, Kronk picks the wrong potion, and instead uses \\'Extract of Llama,\\' which turns Kuzco into one. Yzma sends Kronk out to kill Kuzco, but unable to bring himself to do so, the bag containing the Emperor ends up falling onto the back of a cart belonging to Pacha.\\n\\nPacha returns to his village, but is unable to tell his family what Kuzco said about the destruction of their home. Eventually finding the bag containing Kuzco as a llama, Kuzco then demands that Pacha take him back to the palace. However, Pacha refuses to do so unless Kuzco moves his summer home to another place.\\n\\nKuzco refuses, and wanders off into the nearby jungle. He is almost attacked by a gang of panthers, until Pacha comes to his rescue.\\n\\nBack at the palace, Yzma has taken control of the kingdom, but grows irate when Kronk lets slip that he did not actually kill Kuzco. Yzma then accompanies Kronk to find Kuzco.', 'The film opens at the supermarket Shopwell\\'s on a new day as customers are rolling in. The food there live in their own world where they greet each morning with a song about \"The Great Beyond\", where the \"gods\" (shoppers) take the food to their ultimate destiny.\\n\\nA pack of sausages and a bag of buns are placed next to each other during a 4th of July weekend sale. Frank (voice of Seth Rogen) is a sausage that wants to finally get all up in his bun girlfriend Brenda (voice of Kristen Wiig). He shares the pack with his buddies Carl (voice of Jonah Hill) and Barry (voice of Michael Cera). Barry is the smallest sausage and is mocked by Troy (voice of Anders Holm) and his pals. All the sausages and buns think they are destined to get together in The Great Beyond. For now, Frank and Brenda can only touch tips. They then witness one of the store\\'s employees, Darren (voice of Paul Rudd), whom the food refer to as \"the dark lord\", coming around and throwing out all the expired food, despite the food pleading and insisting that they are still good.\\n\\nLater in the day, Honey Mustard (voice of Danny McBride) gets returned to Shopwell\\'s. He is trembling in fear and appears traumatized, unable to speak about what he has just seen. As this happens, a shopper named Camille Toh (voice of Lauren Miller-Rogen) picks up the sausages and buns, and then Honey Mustard. While the rest of the food in the cart is celebrating being chosen, Honey Mustard stands up and tells the food that everything they have been led to believe about the gods and The Great Beyond is a bunch of bullshit. He says that the gods are preparing them for unspeakable horrors. Refusing to go back, Honey Mustard gets ready to leap off the cart. Frank gets out of his package and runs to catch him, leading Brenda to leave her bag to save Frank. Before falling, Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out Firewater (voice of Bill Hader) to learn the answers he seeks. Another shopper then bumps his cart into Camille\\'s, causing Honey Mustard to fall and crash. Several other products fall and become damaged. Banana\\'s face peels off, Jelly gets splattered, a bag of chips gets popped and his chips slice the other food, and a can of noodles has his guts spill out.\\n\\nFrank and Brenda escape the chaos, but the store is now closed and they\\'re away from their packages. They run into a douche named...Douche (voice of Nick Kroll), who\\'s pissed that his nozzle is bent and therefore he cannot fulfill his purpose to have a woman use him. Douche tries to come at Frank and Brenda, but Darren sweeps him up into the garbage.\\n\\nDouche climbs out of the garbage bin and finds that his side is cracked, causing his juices to leak. He cries about not getting to do what he\\'s made for. Douche then spots a broken grape juice box. He goes over to it and is then inspired to seek out revenge on Frank and Brenda. Douche drinks out of the box\\'s crotch and gets juiced up, ready to get payback.\\n\\nFrank and Brenda head back to their aisles and meet the Armenian flatbread Lavash (voice of David Krumholtz) and Jewish Sammy Bagel, Jr (voice of Edward Norton). The two of them hate each other, as their food groups are made to believe they should. The four of them discover the aisles that form a city in the grocery store. Frank spots the liquor aisle and decides to seek out Firewater. They head down that aisle, and Frank finds Firewater\\'s spot. He leaves Brenda with Lavash and Sammy as he goes to talk to Firewater.\\n\\nFrank encounters Firewater sitting around a fire. Frank asks him what Honey Mustard was talking about. Firewater explains that once the food goes out the door, the gods kill their asses. Thinking Frank has heard too much, Firewater puts a bag over his head and prepares to have him killed, but one of his friends talks him out of it. Frank then meets the Non-Perishables, which also include Mr. Grits (voice of Craig Robinson) and Twink (voice of Scott Underwood).\\n\\nBrenda goes looking for Frank and runs into Tequila (also Bill Hader), who says he knows where to find Frank. He takes Brenda, Lavash, and Sammy to a pub in the Mexican food aisle. Teresa Del Taco (voice of Salma Hayek) sees Brenda and becomes smitten with her. However, she knows that the three are being brought in for a trap. Teresa hides them as Douche arrives. He smashes Tequila and drinks his fluids, getting even more juiced up. Teresa leads the food out a secret passageway.\\n\\nFrank sits with the Non-Perishables as they smoke sativa from their pipe. Firewater admits that because they are Non-Perishable, and therefore immortal, they have seen the barbaric nature of the gods long before the rest of the food in the store, knowing full well what awaits them once they are out the doors. So, they made up the tale of the gods being saviors so that the next wave of food would leave the store happy instead of terrified. Firewater says they also made up the song (he made the tune, Twink made the lyrics), but other food have changed up the meaning to their liking, which upsets Firewater. Frank decides he has to warn everyone about what awaits them. Firewater tells him to go down the Dark Aisle in order to find the proof that he needs to get the food to realize what is really happening.\\n\\nAt Camille\\'s house, all the food is excited to see what they are in for. Camille picks out Potato (voice of Greg Tiernan) first. He is elated and thinks he is about to enter eternity...until Camille starts peeling his skin off, and then drops him into a pot of boiling water. The food then become horrified when a tomato gets chopped in half, a lettuce head is split in two, cheese is grated and microwaved onto nachos, and bacon is fried alive! Two little baby carrots try rolling away to freedom, but Camille catches them and eats them. Carl and Barry make a run for it out the window. They prepare to jump into the bushes when Camille sticks a knife through Carl and slices him upwards. Barry avoids the same fate as he falls into the bushes.\\n\\nBrenda, Teresa, Lavash, and Sammy walk down the back of the aisle. Brenda thinks all the bad stuff is happening because she and Frank touched tips, and now the gods are punishing her. Teresa admits that she has urges that she cannot give into for fear of angering the gods. They are then attacked by the jacked-up Douche. He is about to kill Brenda until she rips off the sticker that kept his juices from leaking. The food manages to escape from Douche as he gets stuck in the walls.\\n\\nBarry is now out in the streets, scared out of his wits. He finds a turd with zombie corn, and then a used condom who laments what he was used for. Barry hides and sees a Druggie (James Franco) stopping by with a Shopwell\\'s bag. The Druggie buys bath salts and walks away. Barry thinks the man can help him get back to Frank to warn him. He runs after the Druggie and hangs onto his shoelace as he drives home.\\n\\nFrank reunites with his friends and tries to get them to follow him to the dark aisle so that he can show them proof of what the gods really do with them. However, Brenda remains firm in her beliefs and feels hurt that Frank would start badmouthing the gods right now. She decides that she would rather go to The Great Beyond without Frank and gets filled with something else, like an eggplant or tube of toothpaste, to Frank\\'s horror. Brenda returns to her aisle and tearfully parts from Teresa. Meanwhile, Lavash and Sammy discover they have a common friend with Hummus, but they remain unable to put their differences aside and return to their arguing groups.\\n\\nNow at the Druggie\\'s home, Barry tries to sneak into the Shopwell\\'s bag. The Druggie them shoots up the bath salts and starts tripping balls. This causes him to be able to see, hear, and speak to Barry, as well as the other food in his room. The Druggie freaks out when he sees the half-eaten and conscious food, as well as the mortified Toilet Paper (voice of Conrad Vernon). Barry then meets a Stephen Hawking-like wad of gum named...Gum (also Scott Underwood), who is the most intelligent being in the world, having been stuck under the desk of a brilliant scientist for decades. Gum figures out how to get Barry back to the closest Shopwell\\'s. The Druggie agrees to help Barry get home, but first he passes out.\\n\\nFrank goes down the Dark Aisle and finds a big recipe book. It contains disturbing depictions of the gods chowing down on food as it is fully aware of being eaten. Frank then sees the page with a sausage and bun being eaten. He rips that page out and sets out to tell the truth.\\n\\nThe Druggie wakes up, but the effects of the bath salts wear off and he can\\'t understand the food anymore. He starts eating the bag of chips, and then reaches for Barry. He goes to throw him in a boiling pot of water.\\n\\nIt is now morning, and the store is about to open. Frank gets himself on camera and speakers to talk to all the food. He tries to explain to them that the gods are going to kill them and not take them to a Great Beyond. Frank shows off the pages of the recipe book, but the food thinks he is just speaking blasphemy and making things up. Frank leaves, defeated, but then reunites with Barry. He brings with him the decapitated head of the Druggie. We see how Barry managed to miss the boiling water, leading the Druggie to try and pick him up, only to knock over the pot and burn himself. Barry grabbed his shoelace and made him slip, causing him to fall and have an axe from from the wall and chop his head off, so Barry and the rest of the Druggie\\'s food (plus Toilet Paper). With this revelation, Frank knows someone else has witnessed the barbarity of the gods firsthand. But now that they know the gods can be killed, the food sets out to stop them once and for all.\\n\\nFrank sees that Brenda is about to be taken away in another package. He races to get her while Barry has the house foods cook the bath salts and dip toothpicks in them, which they shoot at the shoppers and employees. They start to trip out and see the sentient food. The lady with Brenda\\'s package freaks out and tries to run. Frank locks the store down, causing the woman to slam into the door. She grabs Frank, but Brenda whacks her face to the ground. The food tries to get the shopper\\'s attention, but a woman slams a pizza slice against the door. The other shoppers start smashing the food when they see it\\'s alive. This proves to the food that the gods are monsters. They decide it\\'s time to fight back once and for all!\\n\\nThe candy aisle shoots gumballs at an obese man. A bottle of cola and a tube of Mentos sacrifice themselves to go down the man\\'s throat and blow him up. Other shoppers and employees get brutally attacked by the food. Darren goes to get a gun and finds Douche speaking to him. He offers to form an alliance so they can both kill Frank. Douche jumps into Darren\\'s pants and sticks his nozzle up Darren\\'s ass to control him. They go hunting for Frank as Darren shoots the food. Frank is caught by Douche, who takes a bite out of him. Brenda swings down to save Frank while Barry and his friends set up a garbage bin with explosives that hurdles toward Darren and Douche. The bin snatches them up, and the food sets them up to get launched out of the store where they perish in a massive explosion.\\n\\nNow that the food has won, Frank and Brenda decide to do what they\\'ve been wanting to do this whole time...get all up in each other. Lavash and Sammy come out with their feelings for each other and get in on the action, along with Teresa. The whole store them has one epic orgy, including the Non-Perishables, plus Barry and a smushed bun.\\n\\nAfter all the fun, Frank and his friends are guided by Gum to Firewater\\'s lair. He tells them of another terrible truth - all of them are just cartoons coming from the mind of Seth Rogen and his buddies. Gum shows them a machine he\\'s built for them to head out into the real world and cut the strings loose from these puppet masters. Frank and his friends hold hands as they make the leap into another crazy new world.', 'On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:\\n\\nTwenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.\\n\\nThe man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman\\'s arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.\\n\\nThe baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had done--as much as if the statues of the cathedral itself were alive and aware of what they just witnessed. Being fearful for his salvation, Claude Frollo asked what he needed to do, and the Archdeacon told him to raise the child as if he were his own. He reluctantly agreed, but only on the condition that the child lived up in the bell-towers of Notre Dame, away from public view. He wondered to himself if the child might be of use to him in the future.\\n\\nClopin reveals the child\\'s name given by Frollo: Quasimodo, signifying in Latin \"half-formed\" [not a literal translation]. (Sometimes he\\'s called \"Quasi\" for short.) He concludes his tale about \"a man and a monster\" by saying, \" \\'Now here is a riddle to guess if you can,\\' sing the bells of Notre Dame. \\'Who is the monster, and who is the man?\\' \"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the now adult Quasimodo walks out onto a balcony at the base of the bell-towers of Notre Dame, and he is shown to be severely deformed, the most prominent feature being his hunched back. After a brief moment where he helps a young bird learn to fly, he envies the bird and goes back in to his home inside one of the bell-towers. It is filled with old statues; a stained-glass mobile; and wooden models (made by Quasi) of the Notre Dame Cathedral, houses, and various citizens of Paris. He speaks with three stone gargoyles named Victor, Hugo, and LaVerne [who are presumed to be real and alive in this synopsis; it can be argued that they are part of Quasi\\'s imagination, but there are certain scenes which imply they are more than that, as well as scenes in the Direct-to-Video sequel]. He laments that Frollo will not allow him to attend the Festival (or Feast) of Fools later that day, or even leave the bell towers on any other day, but the gargoyles convince him to go out in disguise.\\n\\nBefore he can enact his plan, Frollo arrives with Quasi\\'s lunch, and the gargoyles revert to inanimate stone (they only come alive when Quasi\\'s alone). While going over his alphabet lessons, Quasimodo accidentally reveals his desire to attend the festival. Frollo insists that the Festival of Fools is an affront to everything good, and that he himself only goes because of his duties as a public official. He lies to Quasi, reminding him how his Gypsy mother supposedly abandoned him as a baby, and Frollo was the only one who took him in. [Ironically, that\\'s what happened in the book.] Using these lies, he describes the world as far too harsh and cruel for someone like Quasimodo, and that the cathedral is his only sanctuary. However, in spite of his warnings, Quasi still decides to attend in secret--reasoning that to spend just one day out among everyone else would be worth it.\\n\\nElsewhere in the city, a newly arrived man named Phoebus (along with his horse, Achilles) search in vain for the Palace of Justice. He comes across some performing Gypsies, including the beautiful dancer Esmeralda. They catch each others eye, but before they can speak some city guards come along on patrol. The other Gypsies manage to get away, but Esmeralda gets caught and harassed--accused of stealing the money given by passers-by for their performances. As she struggles to break free, her goat Djali (pronounced like \"jolly\") loosens their grips with a few well-placed kicks and headbutts. Phoebus then uses Achilles to keep the guards from pursuing, much to the onlookers\\' (and Esmeralda\\'s) amusement. Before they can retaliate, Phoebus reveals himself to be the new Captain of the Guard and orders them to take him to the Palace of Justice. Esmeralda watches him from hiding, clearly interested in and intrigued by him.\\n\\nUpon arriving at the Palace, Phoebus meets Minister Frollo in the dungeon (where the former Captain of the Guard is being whipped off-screen, much to Phoebus\\' discomfort). They go out to a balcony where Frollo tasks Phoebus with the top priority of rooting out the Gypsies by finding and destroying their safe haven, which they call the Court of Miracles. Phoebus appears to be skeptical about the whole thing, and probably about Frollo in general, but he mostly keeps his concerns to himself. Hearing the music for the Feast of Fools begin in the distance, they leave to attend.\\n\\nFrom the start of the Feast of Fools, Quasimodo (disguised with a cloak) is like a fish out of water, thanks in no small part to Clopin\\'s antics. During the chaos and commotion, he accidentally stumbles into Esmeralda\\'s tent while she\\'s changing for a dance. She checks to see if he\\'s alright, and he tries in vain to hide his face. However, to his surprise, she isn\\'t phased at all when she sees it. She sends him on his way, and ends by saying, \"By the way, great mask!\" Quasimodo smiles at the irony.\\n\\nFrollo, Phoebus, and the guards arrive at the festival soon afterward, just in time for Esmeralda\\'s dance. She appears on the stage wearing a revealing red silk dress instead of her normal attire. Frollo, Phoebus, and Quasimodo (and basically everybody else) are all captivated by her--though Frollo hides this by voicing his disgust to Phoebus. However, when she approaches him playfully as part of her act, he is speechless. She also notices Quasi during her performance and acknowledges him with a wink, which embarrasses him. The crowd goes wild as she concludes her dance in a glamorous fashion.\\n\\nClopin announces the next item on the agenda, which comes in stark contrast to Esmeralda: They are to crown the \"King of Fools,\" an award to the one who can make the ugliest face in Paris. The contestants go up on stage wearing masks, and then make a face when the mask is removed. Esmeralda innocently invites Quasimodo up on the stage to take part. After all the other contestants are booed (and booted off the stage by Djali), Esmeralda tries to take off Quasi\\'s \"mask.\" She is shocked and frightened when she discovers he wears no mask. The townspeople are horrified, and one of them realizes he must be the infamous bell-ringer of Notre Dame (he being a \"Boo-Radley-esque\" urban legend among them). Frollo hadn\\'t noticed Quasi on the stage up to this point, but he is shocked and disappointed once he does.\\n\\nQuasi starts to hide his face and cry, but Clopin asks the crowd not to panic. He points out that they all asked for the ugliest face in Paris, and surely he fits the bill perfectly. Quickly the crowd goes from repulsion to celebration. As they carry him to a platform in front of the cathedral, Quasi waves sheepishly to Frollo, who scowls in response. He\\'s given a jester\\'s crown, as well as a robe and scepter. They begin chanting his name, and he celebrates along with them.\\n\\nUnfortunately, one of the guards who harassed Esmeralda earlier hits Quasimodo in the face with a tomato. Other guards quickly follow suit. Though the rest of the crowd is shocked at first, they soon see the cruel humor of the situation, so they turn on Quasi. When he tries to get away, people begin to lasso him down. With strength born from years of ringing the enormous bells, Quasimodo pulls many of the ropes off, but he is ultimately overpowered and tied to a wheel on the platform. After tying him, the men give the wheel a vigorous turn, and the crowd continues to pelt him with produce. He calls out to Frollo for help, but it\\'s in vain; when Phoebus asks permission to stop the cruelty, Frollo tells him, \"In a moment, Captain. A lesson needs to be learned here.\"\\n\\nHowever, the shouting and throwing immediately stops when Esmeralda begins to climb the stairs up the platform; she went back to her tent after her last interaction with Quasi in order to change back into her normal clothes, but she quickly returned afterward once she saw what was happening. She approaches slowly, almost hesitantly, and looks at Quasi with pity and sorrow. She asks him not to be afraid as she approaches and wipes the tomato juice from his face, saying, \"I\\'m sorry... This wasn\\'t supposed to happen.\"\\n\\nFrollo orders her to come down, and she replies she will once she frees Quasi from the ropes. When he forbids her, she cuts them anyway defiantly. She calls him out on his wicked behavior and hypocrisy, saying, \"You mistreat this poor boy the same way you mistreat my people! You speak of \\'justice,\\' yet you are cruel to those most in need of your help!\" The crowd stares in awe at her standing up to Frollo. He tells her she\\'ll regret her actions. She, in turn, says he should have been the one crowned King of Fools. Frollo orders Phoebus to arrest her. When he sends his guards for her, however, she manages to evade capture and hide through quick wits, acrobatics, \"smoke and mirrors\" trickery (which Frollo assumed to be witchcraft), and the favor of the crowd. Frollo is furious, and Phoebus is infatuated. Nevertheless, the guards continue their search.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Frollo approaches Quasimodo, and with only a look expresses his anger and disappointment with him; saying \"I told you so\" isn\\'t necessary. Quasi, in tears, replies, \"I\\'m sorry, Master. I will never disobey you again...\" He stumbles back to the Cathedral of Notre Dame through the fearful and murmuring crowd.\\n\\nAfterward, Esmeralda and Djali sneak into the cathedral disguised as a hunched old man in a hooded cloak (similar to Quasimodo\\'s disguise earlier). Phoebus sees through the disguise, but doesn\\'t alert anyone else; instead, he follows her inside. Despite his attempt to approach her quietly, she detects his presence behind her. She turns quickly, pulls his sword out of his sheath, and throws him to the floor. Soon afterward though he takes the sword back and knocks her down. She nearly swears at him (he stops her--pointing out they\\'re in a church), picks up a large candelabrum, and proceeds to duel with him--accompanied with appropriate banter. He surprises her though when he makes it clear he has no desire or intention of arresting her. Instead, he gives her his name and asks for hers in return. She gives it, remarking that he\\'s nothing like the other soldiers.\\n\\nHowever, before anything else can be said, Frollo and several of his guards enter; he thanks Phoebus for finding her, and orders him to arrest her. Esmeralda thinks Phoebus tricked her into staying in place for her to get caught. Instead, Phoebus tells Frollo that she claimed sanctuary, so he can\\'t arrest her. Before Frollo can press the issue, the Archdeacon approaches and tells him to leave her be. He reminds Frollo in vague terms of the last time he violated the law of sanctuary, much to his anger. Frollo sends the guards out, but while the Archdeacon (and Djali) escorts Phoebus out, Frollo sneaks around the pillars and pins Esmeralda\\'s arm behind her back. He threatens her, saying that he can out-wait her and that eventually she will have to exit the cathedral, and then she\\'ll be his. During the course of this threat, it\\'s made clear that he is aroused by Esmeralda--much to her disgust (and his, in a sense).\\n\\nAfter he leaves, she checks and sees that Frollo has guards posted at every door. The Archdeacon warns her not to do anything too rash, that for her safety it would be unwise to anger Frollo more. She justifies her actions by pointing out the injustice and mercilessness of the crowd who abused Quasimodo, and Frollo who let it happen; she had hoped that if one would stand up to Frollo, that this would give people courage to stand up together. Seeing her frustration, the Archdeacon tells her she cannot right all the wrongs in the world, but that even if no one else in the world would help her, perhaps there was \"someone\" else who would.\\n\\nTaking his words to heart, Esmeralda prays (through song) for God to help all the outcasts of the world. Quasimodo, who had retreated back up to the bell-tower, hears her praying and goes down to the main floor to watch her. He is touched by her prayer. However, one of the parishioners sees him and berates him, saying he\\'s caused enough trouble today. He runs back up the staircase, but Esmeralda follows him, saying she wants to talk to him. The gargoyles see her following him, remarking that perhaps the day wasn\\'t a total loss after all. They congratulate him, and thus detain him to allow Esmeralda to catch up. He makes excuses to continue to run, but as she follows him she apologizes for bringing him up on the stage--that had she known who he was, she would have never taken his privacy so callously. When she reaches his home in the tower though, she is silenced with awe by the things inside. She inspects the models of the city, remarking that if she could make things like them she wouldn\\'t be \"dancing in the street for coins.\" He compliments her dancing though, which she accepts bashfully. When she recognizes the wood carvings of people as specific individuals in Paris, she says, \"You\\'re a surprising person, Quasimodo.\"\\n\\nHe offers to give her and Djali a tour of the rest of the tower; she accepts. He shows her the bells, which she enjoys (particularly \"Big Marie,\" the largest one). He then takes her up to the roof of the tower and shows her the sunset. She compliments the tower via hyperbole, saying \"I could stay up here forever.\" When Quasimodo points out she could mean that literally too, she declines--at least not as a prisoner. Through the course of their conversation, Esmeralda learns that Frollo raised him, and that he taught him misconceptions about Gypsies (that they were evil)--and about himself personally; he calls himself a monster. To help him see otherwise, she takes his hand and gives him a palm reading, during which she declares she could find no \"monster lines\" on his palm. She offers him to see hers and asks, \"Do you think I\\'m evil?\" When he declares it isn\\'t so, she replies that perhaps Frollo is wrong about both of them.\\n\\nAfter a moment of silence, Quasimodo feels inspired to help Esmeralda escape her current predicament as payback for her kindness to him earlier. He proposes they climb down from the outside--with Quasi carrying Esmeralda while she holds Djali. She accepts, despite understandable nervousness. Though there are a few close calls, they manage to succeed. Before she leaves, she offers Quasimodo to come with her to the Court of Miracles. He declines, referring to his awful experience earlier--so she offers to come by the cathedral instead, in spite of the danger she would face. He objects, but she calms his fears with some simple yet powerful persuasion. As she leaves, she gives him a necklace with a woven pendant, saying it is the key to being able to find her if he \"ever needs sanctuary.\"\\n\\nWhen he climbs back up to the rooftop, he is approached by Phoebus, who asks if he knows where Esmeralda was. Quasimodo makes it known in no uncertain terms that he isn\\'t welcome there, but Phoebus insists that he means her no harm. He asks Quasi to tell her that he\\'s sorry he got her trapped in the cathedral, but that it was the only way to save her life. On his way out, Phoebus also asks him to tell her that she\\'s lucky to have a friend like Quasi (which surprises him).\\n\\nThe gargoyles congratulate Quasimodo on kicking Phoebus out for intruding and \"trying to steal [his] girl.\" Quasi is incredulous of their assertions that Esmeralda has any feelings for him other than friendship, reminding them that he has the ugliest face in all of Paris--saying, \"I don\\'t think I\\'m her type.\" Yet he also wonders (through song) if it might possibly be true, describing the way she makes him feel as \"heaven\\'s light\" and calling her \"an angel.\" As he muses, he makes a wood carving of her, and places it next to his own.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the Palace of Justice, Claude Frollo feels the opposite towards Esmeralda (and towards himself, though he is slow to admit it). He prays (also through song) about how in spite of his moral strength relative to others, he has fallen for Esmeralda, thus committing the sin of lust. He describes the way she makes him feel as \"hell fire\" and calls her a \"witch\" and a \"siren.\" As he stands before the fireplace, he imagines the flames and smoke taking her form in a seductive fashion. He blames everyone but himself for his feelings and sins. He asks, as punishment for her temptations, that she either be destroyed or \"be [his] and [his] alone.\" At this time one of the guards arrives and tells Frollo that Esmeralda has escaped the cathedral. Frollo sends him out and declares that he\\'ll find her even if he has to burn Paris to the ground to do so. He directs his unholy prayer to Esmeralda, saying, \"Be mine or you will burn!\" He concludes, \"God have mercy on her... God have mercy on me.\"\\n\\nThe next morning, though he is sleep deprived, he orders Phoebus and his men to assemble--giving them the order to \"find the Gypsy girl.\" He accompanies them and has them ransack Gypsy wagons and known hiding places--offering silver pieces to any Gypsy who would reveal Esmeralda\\'s location. Nobody accepts the offer. As Frollo orders more and more Gypsies to be arrested, Phoebus\\' disgust and indignation grows. They eventually arrive at a mill on the outskirts of Paris, where Esmeralda has followed them in disguise (presumably to find out what exactly is going on). Inside, Frollo is interrogating the miller about a Gypsy talisman that was found on their property. (It is unclear whether this talisman was actually found there, or if this was a false accusation by Frollo.) The miller proclaims his innocence and ignorance on the matter, but Frollo tells him and his family that they will be under house arrest until they can verify the claim.\\n\\nHowever, when Frollo bars the door from the outside, he orders Phoebus to burn the mill--saying that they are traitors and need to be made examples. Phoebus protests, and when Frollo refuses to back down he extinguishes his torch in open insubordination. Fixed in his mind, Frollo lights the mill himself, which burns quickly. Phoebus jumps in through the window and kicks open the door from the inside, carrying the miller\\'s infant and toddler, and leading him and his wife outside--just before the mill collapses. As the family runs for safety, Phoebus is struck in the back of the head by one of the guards. While he is held in place, Frollo sentences him to death on the spot, expressing sorrow for his wasted career. Phoebus retorts, \"Consider it my highest honor, sir.\"\\n\\nBefore he is beheaded, Esmeralda saves his life with a well-aimed sling throw that hits Frollo\\'s horse, making it buck. Phoebus uses the distraction to floor the guards, and he escapes on the horse. However, before he can get clear of Frollo\\'s archers, he is struck between his cuirass and pauldron (or torso and shoulder armor) by an arrow. Being on a bridge as it happened, he falls off the horse and into the water below. Frollo and his troops catch up, and he orders them to simply let Phoebus \"rot in his watery grave\" and continue to search for Esmeralda. Meanwhile, Esmeralda herself sneaks under the bridge, and when the others move a safe distance away she dives into the river. She removes Phoebus\\' weighty armor and brings him to shore.\\n\\nAs fires spread throughout Paris, Frollo puzzles over how Esmeralda could have possibly escaped the cathedral. When he hears the bells ringing, he realizes that only Quasimodo could have managed to get her out unnoticed. The perspective switches to Quasi, who worries about Esmeralda. Two of the gargoyles, Victor and Laverne, share his concerns--but Hugo expresses confidence that she\\'s one step ahead of Frollo as usual; not only this, but he tells Quasi she\\'ll be back for him once the city calms down--a sentiment the other two gargoyles agree upon. They say (through song) that Quasimodo is more unique than any other guy in the city, and that what he views as his flaws are actually the things that would endear him to Esmeralda. Quasi doubts she has feelings for him, but even he begins to believe their assurances.\\n\\nCoincidentally, Esmeralda enters the bell-tower at the end of the song. However, instead of coming just to see Quasimodo, she comes seeking shelter for Phoebus--Quasimodo being one of the only people she can trust to keep him safe outside of the Court of Miracles itself (if not the only person). She also needs to tend his wounds more thoroughly, which could only be done in a safe place. Quasi shows them to a relatively comfortable spot in the tower (probably where he sleeps). Esmeralda and Phoebus talk while Quasimodo watches and listens nearby. She disinfects his arrow-wound with wine and sews it shut, and he expresses his discomfort with witty remarks. She reveals her admiration at his bravery and compassion, saying he was lucky the arrow didn\\'t pierce his heart. He puts his hands over hers and says, \"I\\'m not so sure it didn\\'t.\" As they look into each others\\' eyes and see their mutual feelings, they kiss. They don\\'t notice Quasimodo hiding his weeping face while his heart breaks.\\n\\nImmediately afterward, Djali warns them about Frollo, whose carriage just arrived in front of the cathedral. Quasi tells them the way to go to avoid Frollo. Esmeralda tells him to be careful, and asks him to promise not to let anything happen to Phoebus. He promises, in spite of his feelings. He hides Phoebus (who fell asleep from exhaustion) under the table when they leave, finishing up just as Frollo walks in. Frollo acts relatively cheerful and brings a large cluster of grapes with him as a treat, to hide his intentions. As Quasi gets the table ready, Frollo observes that he seems nervous, asking if anything\\'s wrong. When Quasi denies this, Frollo responds, \"Oh but there is. I know there is.\" As they eat, he accuses Quasimodo of hiding something. Phoebus nearly gives himself away as he wakes up again, but Quasi covers it up by coughing (and giving Phoebus a swift kick in the face).\\n\\nFrollo notices the carving Quasimodo made of Esmeralda, and tells him he recognizes her. Here he makes his intentions for coming clear; he angrily accuses Quasi of helping her escape, slamming the figure down on the table. He blames him for the fires ravaging Paris. Quasimodo simply says quietly, \"She was kind to me, Master.\" Frollo destroys the wooden models of Notre Dame Cathedral and the houses in a fit of rage, crying, \"YOU IDIOT! That wasn\\'t kindness; it was cunning! She\\'s a Gypsy! Gypsies aren\\'t capable of real love! Think, boy! Think of your mother!\" By this point he was grasping a terrified Quasimodo, holding his face next to his by his shirt collar. But Frollo quickly checks himself and regains his composure. Saying he doesn\\'t blame Quasi for falling for her enchantments, he tells him not to worry since she\\'ll soon be gone. As he says this, he draws a long dagger from his sleeve and skewers the carving of Esmeralda, burning it over a nearby candle. As he leaves, he tells Quasi that he\\'s found the Court of Miracles, and that he\\'ll attack it at dawn. He descends the stairs with a smile unseen by Quasimodo.\\n\\nPhoebus stands up, having heard the conversation, and says he\\'s going to warn Esmeralda (though he doesn\\'t know where to find her). Seeing that Quasi isn\\'t moving, he asks him if he\\'s coming too. He declines. Phoebus asks, \"I thought you were Esmeralda\\'s friend?\" He replies by saying he can\\'t disobey Frollo again. He retorts, \"She stood up for you! You have a funny way of showing gratitude...\" He leaves, despite having an injured shoulder.\\n\\nQuasimodo turns and sees the gargoyles giving him a disappointed and questioning look. He responds, \"What? What am I supposed to do? Go out there and rescue \\'the girl\\' from the jaws of death, then the whole town will cheer like I\\'m some kind of a hero!? She already has her \\'knight in shining armor,\\' and it\\'s not me! [He sighs] Frollo was right. Frollo was right about everything. And I\\'m tired of being something I\\'m not.\"\\n\\nWhen Quasi says this, he looks down at the palm of his hand that Esmeralda had earlier proclaimed was free of \"monster lines.\" He also looks down at her smoldering carving. He slowly pulls out the woven pendant she gave him, and it is evident that his friendship and care for her has won over his doubt and heartache. Laverne gives him his cloak, and he leaves, saying, \"I must be out of my mind.\"\\n\\nQuasi intercepts Phoebus at the cathedral entrance (having climbed down the outside again). Glad that he changed his mind, Phoebus asks him if he knows where to find her. He holds out the pendant and tells Phoebus what Esmeralda said when she gave it to him. As Phoebus attempts to decipher it, Quasi realizes that it\\'s a map. Phoebus disagrees and they argue, but he concedes--saying that if they are going to find her, they\\'ll have to work together. Quasi agrees enthusiastically.\\n\\nThey reach a graveyard, and find a tomb with a cross matching the one on the pendant. Phoebus checks for writing and clues, but Quasi simply pushes off the heavy stone covering--revealing stairs. It leads to the old catacombs of Paris, filled with skeletons and sewage. They don\\'t notice several Gypsies disguised as skeletons watching them. They are soon ambushed by Clopin and about 20 Gypsies guarding the way. They tie and gag them, accusing them to be spies (understandable given their connections to Frollo, and few knew of Phoebus\\' betrayal). They arrive at the Court of Miracles, where they are nearly hanged. Fortunately, Esmeralda was able to stop that from happening, vouching for them.\\n\\nPhoebus, being freed, delivers the warning that Frollo would attack at dawn. Everyone starts to evacuate. Esmeralda hugs Phoebus, saying they\\'re all grateful. He smiles, but notices Quasimodo standing to the side awkwardly. He brings him forward, saying, \"Without his help, I would never have found my way here.\"\\n\\n\"Nor would I,\" announced Frollo, standing at the entrance with dozens of soldiers running in. They surround and capture the fleeing Gypsies. Frollo callously tells Quasi that he always knew he would be of use to him someday. He tells Esmeralda that Quasi led them right to her; she calls him a liar. He\\'s amused to see Phoebus still alive, saying, \"Another \\'miracle\\' no doubt. I shall remedy that.\" He announces a bonfire to take place the next day, implying Esmeralda\\'s execution, and orders his men to lock them up. Quasimodo gets on his knees before Frollo and begs for him to stop, but it is all in vain.\\n\\nThe next evening, Esmeralda is tied to a stake on the wooden platform in front of the Cathedral of Notre Dame; soldiers place large bundles of sticks by her feet. Phoebus and the Gypsies are forced to watch, being confined to thick metal cages. Frollo reads from a parchment, declaring Esmeralda\\'s crime to be that of witchcraft, and that death is her punishment. A large crowd of Parisians protest, declaring her innocence, but they are held back by soldiers. The Archdeacon too is prevented from interfering.\\n\\nClaude Frollo approaches Esmeralda under the guise of seeking a confession. However, he says to her quietly, \"Even now it is not too late. I can save you from the flames of this world and the next. Choose me, or the fire.\" She answers by spitting in his face, glaring at him with hatred and disgust.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Quasimodo stands trapped on the cathedral balcony, tied up with heavy chains between two pillars. The gargoyles feebly attempt to break one of the chains, but Quasi only hangs limply; he\\'d already tried to break them to no avail. Frollo had already won in his mind. When the gargoyles try to talk him out of this mindset, he curtly tells them to leave. With sadness, they leave one by one, reverting back into inanimate stone. As they go, they say (Hugo, Victor, and Laverne respectively), \"Okay. Okay, Quasi. We\\'ll leave you alone.\" \"After all, we\\'re only made out of stone.\" \"We just thought maybe you were made of somethin\\' stronger...\"\\n\\nHowever, as Frollo\\'s judgment and sentencing echo up towards him, a fire lights within him. He looks over the balcony down to the scene below and sees Claude Frollo light the fuel himself. Indignant, Quasimodo pulls the chains taut with such force that the stone pillars crack; even the bells resonate--as if the cathedral itself were crying out at the injustice below. Esmeralda suffers from the smoke as Frollo looks on with an evil grin. Within several seconds, Quasimodo breaks the stone pillars to which he was tied.\\n\\nFreed from the chains, he grabs a nearby rope, lassos it to one of the overhanging gargoyles used for drainage, and rappels down the side of the cathedral. With a running start along the wall, he swings over the heads of the crowd and lands next to Esmeralda--who is unconscious due to smoke suffocation; the flames are but seconds away from reaching her. He breaks her ropes with his hands. As the guards move in to stop him, he rips the giant stake out with one arm and uses it to knock them off the platform with one swing. Taking the rope again, he holds Esmeralda over his shoulder as he swings back over the rest of the soldiers and climbs up the cathedral wall. The crowd is in a frenzy. When he makes it back up on the balcony, he holds Esmeralda above his head, yelling \"Sanctuary\" as loudly as his lungs can permit. He then takes her to a nearby room, lays her carefully on the bed, and runs back out to prepare to defend the cathedral.\\n\\nIntent on claiming his desire, Frollo orders his men to break down the doors of the cathedral. Quasi drops a large beam down on them to stop them, crushing Frollo\\'s carriage. They take the beam and use it as a battering ram. Meanwhile, Phoebus found an opportunity to knock his guard out, taking his keys and freeing himself. He stands on his cage with a spear in hand, giving this rousing speech to the crowd: \"Citizens of Paris! Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city--and now, he has declared war on Notre Dame herself! Will we allow it?\" The crowd shouts \"No\" in return, overpowering the soldiers holding them back. The Gypsies are freed, and a battle ensues before the doors of Notre Dame. Meanwhile, both Quasimodo and the gargoyles employ various methods to keep the soldiers from climbing the walls. Finally, in one last drastic effort, Quasimodo heats some metal (probably copper or lead) to its melting point and pours it into the drainage system. The molten metal spews out of the mouths of the gargoyles (not Victor, Hugo, and Laverne), and rains down upon the invaders. They run before the metal hits them, but Frollo managed to stay behind the molten \"waterfall.\" He breaks the rest of the way through the doors.\\n\\nThe Archdeacon confronts Frollo, asking, \"Have you gone mad?!\" But Frollo throws him down the stairs and goes to the stairway leading to the bell-towers, locking the door behind him. Quasimodo enters Esmeralda\\'s room in celebration, but his cheer ends abruptly when he sees she isn\\'t moving. He tries to get her to drink some water, but it only spills out of her mouth. Realizing what has happened, he holds her in his arms, weeping bitterly.\\n\\nFrollo enters the room quietly, hiding his dagger behind his back. He puts his hand on Quasi\\'s hunched back. Though he didn\\'t look up, he knew who it was, simply whispering, \"You killed her.\" Frollo claims he was only doing his duty, expressing his hope that he can forgive him. Quasimodo says nothing. Frollo then acknowledges that Quasimodo has had a hard life, but that the time to end his suffering had come. Sensing something wrong, Quasi looks up and sees the shadow of Claude Frollo holding the dagger above his head. He turns in time to grab Frollo\\'s arm before it can reach him. He hesitates for a few seconds, but then he throws Frollo against the wall, taking the dagger from him. He approaches him while holding the dagger, shaking with anger. Frollo attempts to calm him down, asking him to listen, but Quasimodo yells, \"No, you listen! All my life you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place--but now I see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you!\"\\n\\nA voice faintly calls out for Quasimodo. It\\'s Esmeralda, who had not died, but was almost killed from the smoke; she only just regained consciousness. Determined to finish the job, Frollo draws his sword, but Quasimodo takes her in his arms and runs out the door as fast as he can move. Frollo pursues, and eventually finds them hanging onto a gargoyle under the guardrail. He strikes at them with his sword several times (nicking Quasi\\'s arm at least once) as he swings among the gargoyles--with Esmeralda holding on to him for dear life. They\\'re able to get back up onto the guardrail, and Quasi pushes Esmeralda to safety as Frollo nearly hits them again. With malicious intent, Frollo tells him, \"I should have known you\\'d risk your life to save that Gypsy witch... just as your own mother died trying to save you.\" Shocked by this revelation, Quasimodo nearly falls when Frollo smothers him with his cape. However, he grabs the bottom of the railing in time, pulling Frollo down after him--but he doesn\\'t let him go. As Frollo swings and grabs an adjacent gargoyle, all of the events of the past day (both physical and emotional) finally catch up with Quasimodo, and he loses consciousness.\\n\\nFortunately, Esmeralda had regained enough strength to grab Quasi\\'s hand before he let go; however, she wasn\\'t strong enough to pull him up, and she was losing her grip. Frollo stands up on the gargoyle, laughing quietly but maniacally--and he lifts his sword above his head to kill Esmeralda. She looks on in horror, but she doesn\\'t let Quasi go to save herself. Frollo smiles evilly and says, \"And He shall smite the wicked, and plunge them into the fiery pit.\" As if in answer to his proclamation, the gargoyle begins to break beneath his feet. He grabs hold underneath it as he falls, and from his perspective it appears to come alive--it\\'s eyes and mouth glowing with heat and roaring at him with fury. He screams in fear and anguish as the gargoyle breaks off completely, and he falls to his death into the fiery lake of molten metal--as if he were taken straight to hell itself.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Esmeralda loses her grip on Quasi, and she cries out as he falls. But with perfect timing, Phoebus (who had entered the cathedral unnoticed after the metal stopped pouring) reaches out from a lower floor and grabs him, pulling him in. Seeing this, Esmeralda runs to the stairwell. The fall and sudden stop had awoken Quasimodo, and seeing Phoebus, he gives him a big hug in gratitude. Esmeralda enters, and when she sees Quasi alive and well, she runs and embraces him tenderly. They turn to look at Phoebus. Quasimodo takes their hands and clasps them together. Phoebus and Esmeralda embrace each other and kiss--and Quasimodo smiles, being at peace with their love for each other.\\n\\nIn the morning, Phoebus and Esmeralda exit the Cathedral of Notre Dame and are greeted by a cheering crowd. The two raise their hands together in triumph. But instead of going to them, Esmeralda goes back to the doorway of the cathedral and holds her hand out for Quasimodo. He takes it and hesitantly walks out into the light with her. With Frollo dead, his need for sanctuary--claimed by his loving mother so many years ago--is lifted. The people are uncertain how to react. Quasimodo looks worried that he might get rejected again.\\n\\nHowever, a child leaves her mother\\'s side and approaches him. (It is one of the children who watched Clopin\\'s puppet show at the beginning.) Though she\\'s a little nervous (so is Quasi), she reaches for his neck to give him a hug; seeing what she\\'s trying to do, he smiles and lowers himself to her reaching distance. Smiling too as she hugs him, she takes his hand and leads him to the rest of the people--who begin to warm up to him. Clopin shouts, \"Three cheers for Quasimodo!\" The crowd cheers, and they pick him up to go off and celebrate. Esmeralda and Phoebus (and Djali) watch him fondly. Clopin picks up the child and says (sings), mirroring his words at the beginning, \" \\'So here is a riddle to guess if you can,\\' sing the bells of Notre Dame. \\'What makes a monster, and what makes a man?\\' Whatever their pitch, you can feel them bewitch you, the rich and the ritual knells of the bells of Notre Dame!\"\\n\\nAs the citizens of Paris carry him away on their shoulders, Quasimodo is at long last genuinely accepted among them--not as a sideshow and a monster, but as a friend and a man.', 'Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick and Eric Cartman are eager to see the new Terrance and Phillip film, \"Asses of Fire.\" However, they soon learn that due to the film\\'s language, it is rated R, and they need a parent or adult guardian to attend. The boys get around this by bribing a homeless man to purchasing the tickets for them.\\n\\nAfter seeing the film, the boys go to Stark\\'s Pond, where they soon convince the other kids to see the film too. While at the pond, Stan gets the feeling that his girlfriend Wendy Testaburger, may be infatuated with a new kid named Gregory.\\n\\nEventually, Stan confides in Chef, about what he can do to make Wendy happy. This leads to Chef offhandedly saying Stan needs to \"find the clitoris,\" puzzling him over what the school chef means.\\n\\nSoon, the language the kids have heard from the film spills over into the school, soon causing a ban on the kids wearing anything related to Terrance and Phillip. Eventually, a number of parents speak out about the film, with the most vocal being Kyle\\'s mom, Sheila. Though the Canadian Prime Minister on a news program does mention the film\\'s rating, Sheila feels more needs to be done.\\n\\nEventually, guidance counselor Mr Mackey leads the kids in an exercise to get them to say less-naughty words. However, this does not deter the kids from sneaking in to see \"Asses of Fire.\"\\n\\nAfter another viewing, Cartman dares Kenny to light a fart on fire. This ends up causing Kenny to become horribly burned, and he dies in the hospital, while the boys are further reprimanded for seeing the movie again.\\n\\nUnseen by everyone, Kenny\\'s soul goes to Hell, where he encounters Satan, and soon finds out that Saddam Hussein (who had recently been killed by a pack of wild boars), is his lover.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Terrance and Phillip are ambushed on the Conan O\\'Brian show, and placed under citizen\\'s arrest by Sheila and a number of other parents. When Canada\\'s demand that the two entertainers be released is not taken seriously, the country bombs the house of the Baldwin family.\\n\\nThis is seen as a declaration of war by the President of the United States, and a plan is put under attack to attack Canada, and have Terrance and Phillip executed live on television.\\n\\nA newly-designed \"V-chip\" electrically curbs Cartman\\'s use of profanity, much to his disgust. In a showstopping full-cast production number, The four boys form an underground movement called \"La Resistance\" to rescue T&P from electrocution (during a USO show) before America\\'s planned troop surge into Canada. Many town residents have joined the Army, including Chef, whose segregated unit is expected to serve as cannon fodder in \"Operation Human Shield\", much to Chef\\'s disgust. In Hell, Satan grows increasingly unhappy over continually taking mental abuse from the eternally-horny Saddam Hussein. \"La Resistance\" mounts a rocky but ultimately successful rescue attempt during the USO show (\"Just remember what the MPAA says--\\'Horrific, deplorable violence is OKAY, as long as people DON\\'T SAY ANY NAUGHTY WORDS!\\' \"). After the Canadian army\\'s surprise invasion and subsequent horrific battle, Terence and Philip are shot. Once their innocent blood touches the ground, Satan and his minions, and Saddam, come out of Hell to begin conquering Earth. Saddam usurps Satan\\'s prerogative and tries to take over all by himself and is attacked by Cartman, whose V-chip has malfunctioned so that he shoots lightning every time he says a bad word. Encouraged by Kenny, Satan puts Saddam down once and for all, and restores everything on Earth to the way it was before T&P were killed. The boys\\' mothers learn to blame their own foul-mouthed children rather than \"blaming Canada\", and everyone rejoices as Kenny gets into Heaven in the big musical finale.', 'No Synopsis', 'During the Han Dynasty in ancient China, the legendary Great Wall fails to keep out the notorious Hun army and their ruthless leader, Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer). The alarm is raised, and the Emperor (Pat Morita) entrusts General Li (James Shigeta) with mobilizing an army to protect China. The wise Emperor reminds the general that \"one man may be the difference between victory and defeat.\"\\n\\nFa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), the teenage daughter of prosperous farmer Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh), nervously prepares for her meeting with the village matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes). Though clever and kindhearted, Mulan is a tomboyish klutz who has little faith in her ability to become a poised and dignified bride. After rushing through her morning chores, she meets her mother, Fa Li (Freda Foh Shen), and grandmother (June Foray) in town and is bathed and dressed before joining the other girls at the matchmaker\\'s house (\"Honor to Us All\"). Mulan\\'s eccentric grandmother insists that Mulan take a live cricket with her for good luck, but the insect escapes from its cage and wreaks havoc at the meeting. Mulan is deemed a disgrace, and is told she will never bring honor to her family.\\n\\nDeeply ashamed, Mulan returns home and laments that she is not the daughter her parents deserve (\"Reflection\"). Her father, however, comforts her with the metaphor that the cherry blossom late to bloom may be the most beautiful of all.\\n\\nThe Emperor\\'s smug councilman, Chi Fu (James Hong) arrives at Mulan\\'s village to draft one man from each family for the imperial army. Mulan watches in fear as young men are called forward to receive their orders, knowing that her aging and weak father will be called up as well, being the only male member of the Fa family. As Fa Zhou is summoned by Chi Fu, Mulan pleads for her father to be excused from battle, as he is already a veteran and is afflicted with an injured leg. Fa Zhou reprimands her for her interference, and insists he will go to training camp the next day with the other soldiers. Knowing her father will die if put in combat again, Mulan makes a desperate decision. After her parents are asleep, she cuts her hair short, dons her father\\'s armor, and takes his draft information before riding out to the camp in his place. Fa Zhou and Fa Li awaken and discover with horror that their daughter has left to join the army. They cannot go after her, for impersonating a soldier is a capital offense, and Mulan would be executed if her identity was revealed. Grandmother Fa prays to their ancestors to protect Mulan.\\n\\nIn the small temple on the Fa\\'s property, the spirits of the ancestors awaken to discuss what to do about Mulan. Mushu the dragon (Eddie Murphy), a disgraced former guardian, is sent to awaken the Great Stone Dragon, the most powerful guardian, to bring Mulan home safely. While grumpily trying to wake the statue by ringing a ceremonial gong, Mushu accidentally reduces it to rubble. He manages to hide this mishap from the ancestors, and encounters Cri-Kee, the \"lucky\" cricket who had accompanied Mulan to the matchmaker. The two eventually decide to go after Mulan themselves. Mushu plans to help Mulan excel in the army, thus earning back his place among the ancestors as a guardian.\\n\\nAs China continues to prepare for war, Shan Yu and the Huns are riding quickly through the wilderness toward the city. Hun soldiers capture two imperial scouts, and Shan Yu tauntingly instructs them to tell the Emperor to send his finest troops to battle the Huns. Reasoning that it only takes one man to deliver a message, Shan Yu has one of the scouts executed.\\n\\nMulan arrives at the outskirts of the training camp, terrified of her task and dejectedly telling her horse, Khan, that it would take a miracle for her plan to work. As if on cue, Mushu and Cri-Kee appear, with Mushu falsely introducing himself as a trusted guardian sent by her ancestors and promising to help her become a model soldier. Mulan timidly enters the camp and, following Mushu\\'s bizarre instructions on how to impersonate and interact with men, inadvertently causes a brawl. The ruckus is quelled by Captain Li Shang (B.D. Wong), the son of General Li, who was appointed by his father to train the new troops while Li takes his army to protect the Imperial City. Shang is unimpressed with the sloppy new recruits, especially awkward Mulan, who presents herself as \"Ping,\" Fa Zhou\\'s little-seen son.\\n\\nThe next morning, training begins in full. This is especially harrowing for Mulan because her fellow soldiers are still angry with her for the camp-wide fight the previous day. None of the recruits are especially skilled or athletic, but Shang proves to be a diligent coach (\"I\\'ll Make A Man Out of You\"). The troops steadily improve, and Mulan finally redeems herself by being the first soldier to conquer the seemingly impossible task Shang set them on their first day. The troops had been burdened with heavy arm weights and told to retrieve an arrow from the top of an enormous wooden pole. Mulan, after some trial and error, cleverly uses the weights to her advantage, scaling the pole and reaching the arrow. The other troops begin to warm up to \"Ping,\" especially grouchy Yao (Harvey Fierstein), goofy Ling (Gedde Watanabe), and enormous but gentle Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo). Mulan has an increasingly difficult time keeping her gender a secret, especially since the men all bathe together in a nearby lake. Mushu is called upon to provide distractions when Mulan\\'s identity is in immediate danger of being discovered.\\n\\nShan Yu plans to move his army through a mountain pass, which is the swiftest route to the Imperial City. Though he determines that General Li and his army are already guarding the pass, Shan Yu confidently leads the Huns to battle the imperial troops.\\n\\nChi Fu, the Emperor\\'s council, has remained at Shang\\'s camp to compile a report on the new troops. Though the soldiers have successfully completed training, Chi Fu remains unimpressed and behaves rudely toward Captain Shang. Mushu, continuing his plan to transform Mulan into a war hero, has Cri-Kee forge a letter from General Li, requesting backup troops at the mountain pass. The ruse works, and Shang marches the troops out of camp the following day. During their trek, Mulan\\'s friends keep their spirits up by daydreaming about their ideal women (\"A Girl Worth Fighting For\"), but their optimism is short-lived. When they reach the mountain pass, they find the village razed and General Li and his entire platoon slaughtered. Shang is shocked and grief-stricken at his father\\'s death, but is all the more determined to stop Shan Yu from reaching the city and the Emperor.\\n\\nAs Mulan, Shang, and the troops progress through the snowy mountains, Mushu accidentally sets off a cannon and gives away their position. The Huns immediately attack, and it is evident that they greatly outnumber the soldiers. As the Hun army charges toward them, Shang instructs Yao to aim their last cannon at Shan Yu. Though now in direct combat with the Hun leader himself, quick-thinking Mulan swipes the cannon and fires it at the mountainside, causing a huge avalanche that buries Shan Yu and the rest of the Huns. The soldiers run for safety, with Shang and Mulan narrowly avoiding falling to their deaths over a cliff. Shang thanks Mulan for saving their lives, and gets her medical attention for an injury she sustained from Shan Yu\\'s sword. While unconscious in the medic\\'s tent, Mulan\\'s gender is discovered and she is ousted to the rest of the troops. Chi Fu pressures Shang to execute Mulan immediately, but Shang, though angry at Mulan for her deception, refuses to kill her. He orders the troops to march on, leaving Mulan in the mountains with her horse and supplies.\\n\\nMulan miserably tells Mushu that entering the army was a mistake, and that she was fated to dishonor her family. Mushu finally admits that he was not sent by the ancestors, and that his mission was a selfish one to get his job back. Even Cri-Kee confesses that he is not a truly lucky cricket. They are all about to give up hope when they discover that Shan Yu and many of the Huns had survived the avalanche and are emerging from the snow. Mulan, Mushu, Khan and Cri-Kee rush to the Imperial City to warn of the coming attack.\\n\\nIn the city, Captain Shang and his troops are being hailed as heroes for defeating the Huns. Though surrounded by cheering citizens, Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chein-Po are noticeably dejected. Mulan, presenting herself as a woman again, confronts Shang during their victory parade and tells him what she saw in the mountains. Shang dismisses her as a liar, and members of the crowd are deaf to Mulan\\'s words. On the steps of the palace, the Emperor begins a speech of gratitude to the Chinese army, but Hun soldiers had beaten Mulan to the city and disguised themselves as members of the parade. To the crowd\\'s horror, the Huns emerge and seize the Emperor, carrying him into the palace and barring the doors. Knowing of Mulan\\'s knack for creative problem-solving, Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po turn to her for a rescue plan. With all except Shang disguising themselves as concubines, they infiltrate the palace and attack the Huns guarding the chamber into which the Emperor was taken. Shan Yu threatens to kill the Emperor if he refuses to bow to him and accept him as the new leader of China. The Emperor stoically refuses and Shan Yu prepares to strike, but Shang leaps into action just in time. As Shang and Shan Yu battle, Chien-Po carries the Emperor to safety. Mulan then attracts Shan Yu\\'s attention by proving herself to be the soldier who started the avalanche, luring him to the roof of the palace for a final fight. Mushu, armed with an enormous firework rocket, launches himself at Shan Yu. As the Hun leader is blasted to smithereens in a colorful display, Mulan and Mushu drop to safety on the palace steps.\\n\\nAs the chaos subsides, Chi Fu berates Mulan for her actions. Shang angrily defends her until the Emperor appears. He explains to Mulan that, despite her fraud, she has saved the entire nation of China. In the ultimate display of respect, the Emperor bows to Mulan, as do the countless people in the attending crowd. He then offers Mulan a place in his council (to the shock of Chi Fu), but Mulan respectfully declines and expresses her wish to return home. The Emperor gives her his medallion and Shan Yu\\'s sword as gifts to honor the Fa family.\\n\\nBack at the Fa estate, Fa Zhou is overjoyed at the return of his daughter. Though Mulan presents him with the Emperor\\'s crest and the sword of Shan Yu, he casts the priceless gifts aside and embraces her, assuring her that she herself is the greatest honor to their family. Captain Shang arrives soon afterward, returning the helmet that Mulan left behind, and awkwardly but happily accepts Mulan\\'s invitation to stay for dinner.\\n\\nMushu, at last, is restored to guardian status in the family temple. Mulan thanks him for his help in her adventurous plan, and the ancestors celebrate that the Fa family is complete again.', \"After saving the arcade from the Cy-Bugs invasion and from Turbo's revenge, six years have passed when Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz are still best friends who hang out every night after work in Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. However, six years of being a racer in Sugar Rush has caused Vanellope to express quandaries with the increasing predictability of her game, so Ralph tries to surprise Vanellope with a new hidden track in Sugar Rush. Vanellope enjoys the track but goes against the controls of the player to ride it, causing the wheel on the console to get stuck, and the player to accidentally remove the wheel from the game. Mr. Litwak inadvertently breaks the wheel while trying to reattach it. Knowing that the company who made the part went out of business years ago, Litwak has no choice but to unplug Sugar Rush, rendering Vanellope and its citizens homeless.\\n\\nAfter a conversation with Fix-It Felix Jr. in Tapper's, Ralph decides to venture with Vanellope via the newly installed Wifi router to the Internet to find and purchase a new wheel for Sugar Rush from eBay. The two follow Litwak's avatar and meet KnowsMore, a search engine who points them towards eBay. Ralph and Vanellope successfully acquire the wheel via auction, but find they have no money to complete its purchase, which they are told will expire within 24 hours.\\n\\nAfter consulting a pop-up advertiser named Spamley, Ralph and Vanellope venture to a popular online game, Slaughter Race, to steal a valuable car they can sell to cover the auction. After engaging in a high-speed chase throughout Slaughter Race, the car's owner Shank commends Vanellope for her racing skills, causing visible jealously in Ralph at the budding friendship. Despite not allowing the pair to take her car, Shank points the duo towards video sharing site BuzzzTube after posting a video of Ralph taking a leaf blower to the face. They meet up with an algorithm named Yesss who gives Ralph the funds earned from his videos' popularity. When the money earned turns out to not be enough to keep Vanellope from returning to Slaughter Race to consult Shank, Ralph decides to make more videos playing off the top trends to earn more money.\\n\\nRalph becomes a viral sensation with Yesss playing off this by having her assistants venture out into the internet and spamming users with pop up ads. Wanting to feel useful, Vanellope offers up her services as a pop-up advertiser. Not wanting Vanellope to fall back into Slaughter Race, Ralph has Yesss appoint her to the fansite Oh My Disney! where Vanellope realizes that she is an unauthorized advertiser and ends up meeting the Disney Princesses. The Princesses speak to Vanellope and stress the importance of finding and pursuing one's dream through song, inspiring her to return to Slaughter Race.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ralph successfully earns the money for their eBay bid, despite being hurt after reading the rude and mean-spirited comments posted on his videos. After being accidentally answered over the phone and put on mute, Ralph finds Vanellope back in Slaughter Race confiding in Shank about her desire to stay there and leave the arcade. Desperate to not lose his friend, Ralph approaches Spamley about any possible virus that would make Slaughter Race more boring and less desirable for Vanellope. Spamley takes Ralph to the dark web where they meet Double Dan, who gives them an insecurity virus that analyzes any imperfection and spreads it to other parts of its surrounding area. The virus, scanning Vanellope, spreads her glitch throughout Slaughter Race, causing the game to shut down and reboot, almost killing Vanellope and Ralph in the process until Ralph breaks out from the game before it shuts down.\\n\\nVanellope discovers Ralph's actions and berates him for them, asking him to leave her alone. The surviving virus escapes Slaughter Race and scans Ralph's insecurities and spreads them throughout the Internet itself. The virus manifests into hundreds of alternate versions of Ralph that tear up the Internet in a rampant search for Vanellope. With the help of Knowsmore and Yesss, the pair attempt to lead the horde of virus Ralphs to an anti-virus software. The virus Ralphs form a giant Ralph that capture Vanellope, as Ralph attempts to fight them off. Ralph catches their attention and calls them out on their selfish possessiveness of Vanellope, claiming that letting go and accepting her choice to stay in Slaughter Race does not have to mean the end of their friendship, and can actually strengthen their bond. Having let go of his insecurities, the gigantic virus Ralph disappears, in the process dropping Ralph, who is saved with the help of Spamley and the Disney Princesses.\\n\\nThe Internet is restored and Vanellope decides to stay in Slaughter Race, with Ralph returning to the arcade and participating in activities with the other arcade members, while regularly video chatting with Vanellope. He watches the sunrise from Game Central Station, coming to peace with the changes in his life as he heads to work with Felix.\\n\\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ralph and Vanellope crash a child's Pancake Milkshake game on her iPad. In a post-credits scene, a Frozen 2 trailer is teased, only for Ralph to rickroll the audience.\", 'Former toon Private Eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is called to the Maroon Cartoon Studios lot at the request of its owner, R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern). Maroon is upset that one of the studio\\'s biggest stars, Roger Rabbit, has already put the latest Baby Herman cartoon over-budget by $25,000. Maroon chalks Roger\\'s acting mistakes up to him being worried about his wife, Jessica. Recent newspaper articles have circulated rumors that Jessica is seeing someone else. Maroon assigns Valiant to get pictures to confirm this rumor. When Valiant claims he doesn\\'t work in Toontown, Maroon tells him that Jessica performs at a club in Los Angeles called \\'The Ink and Paint Club.\\' Valiant accepts the assignment for $100, of which Maroon pays $50 upfront, and the other half promised upon completion of the assignment.\\n\\nLater that evening, Valiant goes to the Ink and Paint Club, where he encounters Toontown\\'s owner and \\'gag king, Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) in the audience. Acme playfully squirts ink on Valiant\\'s shirt, which infuriates the Private Eye, until it is revealed that the ink is \\'disappearing ink.\\' Shortly afterwards, the show starts, and Valiant is shocked to find that Jessica is not really a rabbit, but a shapely toon woman. After the show, Valiant sneaks out the back to a window, and sees Jessica in her dressing room, with Marvin Acme, playing pattycake.\\n\\nValiant takes pictures, and shows them to Roger and Maroon in the Studio Head\\'s main office. Infuriated by the photos, Roger claims that he and his wife will be happy again, and bolts from the office.\\n\\nThe next day, Valiant is awoken by Lieutenant Santino (Richard LeParmentier), who has come to inform him that Marvin Acme was killed the night before. Currently, Roger is the prime suspect, given what he said to Maroon and Valiant. At the Acme Gag Factory, Valiant is introduced to Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), and his gang of Weasels that run his \\'Toon Patrol\\' gang. Having jurisdiction over Toontown, the judge explains to Valiant that in order to \\'rein in the insanity,\\' he has resorted to a new method on which toons can be killed: The Dip, a mixture of turpentine, acetone, and benzine. The Judge demonstrates the Dip to Valiant at the Gag Factory, when he dips and obliterates a squeaking toon shoe.\\n\\nValiant returns to his office, only to find Baby Herman waiting for him. Herman pleads with the detective that Roger is innocent, and that Acme was most likely \\'bumped off\\' because he owned Toontown. Acme had once made a solemn oath that he would leave Toontown in the ownership of the toons if anything happened to him, according to Herman. However, while there is talk that Acme had a will that stipulated this, noone has ever seen it.\\n\\nValiant goes into his office, and after glancing at one of the pictures of Jessica and Acme, notices that in Acme\\'s coat pocket, is a piece of paper that says \\'last will and testament.\\' Settling down for a small nap, Valiant finds Roger is hiding in his bed. Roger it seems, was able to find Valiant\\'s office, but not after asking a number of people for help. However, it is most likely that since he\\'s a wanted rabbit, someone has most likely told the Toon Patrol about his whereabouts. Valiant tries to get rid of Roger, but the rabbit pleads with the detective to take his case and help clear his name.\\n\\nRoger explains that after he got upset about the pictures, he went to the Ink and Paint Club to see Jessica. Not finding her in her dressing room, he wrote her a love letter on a piece of paper that was lying around. He waited for her to appear, but when the weasels showed up looking for him, he took the love letter and ran away. Valiant wonders just why Roger would come to him, seeing as how he took the pictures of Roger\\'s wife. Roger explains because of Valiant\\'s past career of helping toons.\\n\\nAt one point, Roger gets a bit carried away, and accidentally handcuffs himself to Valiant. It doesn\\'t help that Valiant has no keys to the cuffs, and the weasels have shown up looking for Roger. Valiant pretends to be washing his laundry in the sink when they arrive, and after the weasels leave, Roger emerges from the sink. Valiant then goes across the street to the Red Car Trolley Station, where his girlfriend Dolores (Johanna Cassidy) is working at a restaurant. She allows them both into a hidden room at the rear of the restaurant, where Valiant gets the handcuffs off, and tells them that he believes that Acme\\'s death was set-up by R.K. Maroon, and that Maroon wants to get control of Toontown. Valiant has Roger stay in the hidden room, while he goes back to his office. Meanwhile, Valiant sends Dolores downtown to check the probate of Acme\\'s will.\\n\\nAfter taking a shower, he emerges to find Jessica has come into the office, asking for help finding Roger. Valiant claims that she most likely needs Roger to \\'make the scheme work,\\' but Jessica claims that she does love her husband, and that her \\'figure\\' often leads to speculation of her being \\'bad.\\' Jessica further goes onto explain that the pictures that Valiant took were set-up. Maroon had wanted to blackmail Acme, and promised Jessica that if she didn\\'t go along with his scheme, Roger would never work in pictures again. Caring for her husband, she allowed herself to go along with the scheme.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, Dolores shows up, and explains that Valiant\\'s theory is incorrect. Maroon appears to have no intentions of obtaining Toontown. According to the probate, a company called Cloverleaf Industries put in a bid for the rights to Toontown, and at midnight, they will have ownership unless Acme\\'s will turns up. It also happens that Cloverleaf Industries also recently claimed ownership of the Red Car Trolley Line. Valiant and Dolores return to the restaurant, only to find Roger dancing about to the amusement of the guests. Valiant throws Roger and himself into the hidden room, just before Judge Doom and his weasels appear. Everyone in the room denies that Roger was there, but Doom gets him to appear by tapping and singing \\'Shave and a haircut.\\' According to Doom, no toon can resist this song, without finishing it with \\'two bits.\\' As expected, Roger appears, and is then accosted by Doom. Valiant saves the rabbit by offering him a drink. Roger\\'s inability to hold his alcohol, turns his head into a giant steam whistle. Valiant knocks out the weasels, and rushes out of the bar with Roger leading the way.\\n\\nTryring to use the weasel\\'s Toon Patrol wagon, they encounter a cartoon cab named Benny in the rear of the car. Valiant and Roger then use Benny to escape from the weasels. Benny deposits them at a theater, where Roger is enjoying the \\'Goofy\\' cartoon playing on the screen, but Valiant is still upset. Roger, who has grown perplexed at Eddie\\'s attitude, asks what happened to turn him into such a \\'sourpuss.\\'\\n\\nValiant then explains that his partner and brother, Teddy, was killed by a toon. Many years ago, while investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown, Eddie and Teddy were chasing a guy who dropped a piano on them from 13 stories up. The piano broke Eddie\\'s arm, but killed Teddy. Valiant never did find out who the toon was, except that he had \\'burning red eyes\\' and a \\'high squeaky voice.\\' Roger feels terrible about this, and sobs that Eddie is justified in his hatred of him and toons. Eddie claims he doesn\\'t hate Roger, and the toon rabbit is overjoyed.\\n\\nOn their way out of the theater, a newsreel plays footage of Cloverleaf Industries executives making a deal with R.K. Maroon, and Valiant thinks he\\'s finally found the \\'connection!\\' Valiant places a call to R.K. Maroon, telling him he has the will, as a way to get in to see the Studio Owner. Arriving at the studios, Roger is told to stay by the car.\\n\\nValiant meets with Maroon, who seems very nervous about the whole thing. Valiant uses Roger\\'s love-letter as a ploy to throw Maroon off-guard, and then knocks the Studio Owner to the floor, wanting answers. When Maroon denies any wrongdoing, Valiant runs his tie through a movie-o-la, almost strangling him. Maroon explains that he had a chance to sell his studio, but Cloverleaf also wanted Acme\\'s property as well. When Marvin refused, Maroon planned to blackmail him with pictures of him (Acme) and Jessica. Maroon then goes on to try and explain more, when suddenly gunfire erupts, and Maroon is wounded. Valiant goes to the window where the shots came from, only to see Jessica running away.\\n\\nValiant returns to his car, only to find Roger gone. Giving chase, he follows Jessica\\'s car but stops when it drives into the tunnel leading to Toontown. Valiant arms himself with a toon gun (complete with toon bullets), and heads into Toontown. After a series of madcap hijinks through the toon city, Valiant finds himself in an alley, with Jessica pulling a gun on him. However, the bullet she fires streaks right past him. When she approaches, she points to a gun on the ground behind him. Apparently, Doom was planning to shoot Valiant, and her bullet saved his life. This is the same gun that was used to kill R.K. Maroon. Far off in the distance, the two see Doom running away, claiming that they\\'re \\'all dead.\\'\\n\\nJessica and Valiant try to get Valiant\\'s car to give chase, but it appears to be gone. As well, roger has disappeared from Jessica\\'s trunk (apparently, she had knocked him out and put him in the trunk to keep him from getting hurt). Both Jessica and Valiant manage to thumb a ride from Benny, who helps them escape from Toontown. In the car, Jessica tells Valiant that Acme knew Doom was after Toontown, and gave her the will for safekeeping. However, the envelope containing the will only held a blank sheet of paper.\\n\\nOn the other side of the tunnel, Doom is waiting with a barrel of Dip, that ends up flattening Benny\\'s tires, causing him to crash. Doom then has Valiant and Jessica taken to the Acme Factory. The two are frisked for the will, but nothing is found. It is then that Doom explains his master plan. Planning to end his career as a Toontown judge, he is now going to take advantage of his stake in Cloverleaf Industries (of which he is the sole stockholder). Pulling aside a giant cloth, he shocks Jessica and Valiant with a giant Dipmobile, containing enough dip to wipe out Toontown in a matter of minutes. Doom\\'s master plan is to build a freeway in its place: a concept that will allow high-speed driving, and end traffic jams. Valiant balks at this, saying that people can still take the Red Car Trolley Line for a nickel. It is then that Doom reveals that his purchasing of the Trolley Line was part of his plan, as he plans to dismantle the transportation system, making people have no alternative but to use his freeway system.\\n\\nJust then, Roger bursts through a sewer pipe, but is quickly subdued. Doom has both Roger and Jessica hung at the far end of the room, planning to \\'dip\\' them. As he confidently walks away, he trips on some spilled gag eyeballs and falls to the ground. Angered at the weasel\\'s laughing, he angrily shouts, \\'One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!\\' As he disappears around a corner, Valiant manages to distract the weasels, by tumbling, falling, and using some Acme gags nearby. His lunacy causes the weasels to do just as the judge promised, and they all die laughing. However, one of the weasels, Psycho, had turned on the dipmobile\\'s cannon, which is heading right for Roger and Jessica. Valiant manages to abort the cannon\\'s direction, but not before being knocked about by Judge Doom. During the scuffle, Doom ends up getting his hand and foot coated in a super-strong glue, and soon ends up under the front of an Acme steamroller. Screaming at his predicament, he is severely flattened. However, he suddenly rises off the floor, hopping about. Valiant makes the correct assumption that the Judge was actually a toon. Re-inflating himself, Doom reveals who he really is: the toon that many years ago killed Teddy Valiant. Doom then starts the dipmobile back up, and then proceeds to kill Eddie with a giant toon buzzsaw. However, Eddie opens a rear valve on the dipmobile, sending a wall of dip on Doom, causing him to melt into a puddle of paint.\\n\\nWith the dip spent, Roger and Jessica are saved, as the dipmobile then crashes through the wall, creating an opening into Toontown, where the dipmobile is hit by a fast-moving train.\\n\\nAfter Eddie manages to clear the Gag Factory\\'s floor of dip, Roger and Jessica are lowered to the ground, just in time for Benny to return with the police, Dolores, and Lt. Santino. Eddie explains that it was actually Doom who killed Marvin Acme, as well as R.K. Maroon, and his brother Teddy. All the toons of Toontown arrive to see the carnage and comment about the death of their would-be murderer. As Baby Dolores complains their town is still in danger of being demolished by another developer, Delores notices a stain on Eddie\\'s shirt, it appears that the ink that Acme squirted him with, according to Roger, was \\'disappearing and reappearing\\' ink. Getting an idea, Eddie returns the love letter to Roger, who begins to read it. As Roger reads the letter, a number of words begin to appear, and Eddie\\'s hunch is correct: The blank piece of paper that Roger found in Jessica\\'s dressing room, was Acme\\'s will, written in invisible ink, and as promised, the will gives ownership of Toontown to the toons!\\n\\nHaving noted Valiant\\'s funny dance for the weasels, Roger asks Eddie if he has gotten over being a sourpuss. When Eddie mentions that \\'only time will tell,\\' Roger offers to shake his hand...but failing to mention a hand-buzzer that shocks Eddie! Eddie pulls his hand away, with an angry look. \"Don\\'t tell me you\\'ve lost your sense of humor already,\" says a fearful Roger. Eddie then grabs him by the neck and asks, \"Does this answer your question?\" Eddie\\'s \\'answer\\' is a cartoony kiss to Roger\\'s lips...proof that Eddie has gotten his sense of humor back!\\n\\nEddie, Dolores, Roger and Jessica then walk off towards Toontown, as a number of cartoon characters sing the song, \\'Smile, darn ya, smile!\\' Meanwhile, Porky Pig is among the Toon cops clearing the scene and realizes he has found a good line to end the story, \"That\\'s All, Folks!\" as he address the audience just before Tinkerbell flies in to tap the scene in her own tradition to bring this unique film collaboration to a close.', \"The movie starts with a narration about the minions, how they have existed since long ago, seeking the most evil entity to serve. The change from master to master is due to the fact that they often cause their masters' demise. One day they find themselves isolated in an ice cavern and thrive as a tribe. But as time passes they lose spirit in living because they don't have a master. A minion Kevin decides to go to the outside world to find a master. He gets Stuart and Bob as his companions. They arrive in New York and after some time wandering around they find a secret villain TV channel that announces the Villain Con in Orlando. Hitching a ride with the Nelsons, who turn out to be villains also, the minions reach Villain Con. There they see Scarlet Overkill, then the worlds most notorious villain, who turns out to be seeking henchmen. Bob accidentally wins the contest to become Scarlet's henchman.\\n\\nThe minions follow Scarlet to her castle and Kevin phones his fellow minions to come. She tasks the minions to steal the royal crown from Queen Elizabeth of Britain. With gadgets from Scarlet's husband Herb, the minions succeed in stealing the crown but get caught red handed so they run from capture, until Bob accidentally releases the sword in the stone from the Excalibur legends. Thus Bob is crowned king. Scarlet is infuriated by this and visits the minions. They happily give the crown and the kingship to Scarlet. But Scarlet instead sends them to a torture chamber. But somehow the minions are immune to the torture equipment and they sneak back into Scarlet's coronation ceremony to apologize. But again theiy bodge it, as instead they crash an ancient chandelier onto Scarlet's head. Scarlet sends the other villains from Villain Con after the minions. Stuart and Bob get captured.\\n\\nKevin escapes and stumbles onto Herb's secret weapon, which transforms him into a gigantic minion. He saves Stuart and Bob while battling Scarlet, while the rest of the minions arrive. Kevin swallows Scarlet's rocket but prevents her escape, blowing her up and returning Kevin to his size. Kevin, Stuart and Bob are rewarded by the Queen. But Scarlet is still alive and returns to steal the crown, only to be stopped by young Gru, who takes the crown and gains the minions as his servants.\"]\n"
